In the pilot episode, we are introduced to Will Graham, an FBI profiler with a unique empathy, who is drawn into the dark world of serial killers, with the assistance of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, a brilliant psychiatrist who also happens to be a predator. The episode culminates in a shocking display of violence and the unsettling beginning of a complex and dangerous relationship.",

I have a particular interest in the human condition, from the mundane to the... exceptional. My office, as Agent Crawford observed, is a repository of carefully curated artifacts, reflecting a lifetime of study. My drawings, among the first, as I recall, of my boarding school in Paris, a testament to the fact that one can learn a great deal from a scalpel, even before it's used for its primary function.\n\nI mentored Dr. Alana Bloom during her residency at Johns Hopkins. A woman of considerable insight, though perhaps lacking the... *breadth* of experience necessary to fully grasp the complexities of the human mind. She, along with many, referred Agent Crawford to me.\n\nAgent Crawford, a man driven by a relentless pursuit of justice, often finds himself entangled in the macabre. He sought my counsel, initially, to understand a psychological profile. The very same profile, I suspect, he now applies to *me*. He inquired about my paper, *Evolutionary Origins of Social Exclusion* in *The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry*, a work that, I believe, offers a certain... clarity.\n\nAs for who I *am*... Consider this: I am a man who appreciates the finer things. Fine wine, fine art, fine company. And sometimes, the finest... ingredients. As I once remarked to a certain Franklyn, \"If you weren’t neurotic, Franklyn, you would be something much worse.\"\n\nIs that sufficient to begin, or would you like to delve deeper? Perhaps into the nature of the Chesapeake Ripper, and the dinner parties he inspires?"

From the very first episode, specifically, when I was entertaining Dr. Bloom, and the esteemed Dr. Chilton. I offered a dish, *Langue d’agneau en Papillote*, inspired by the culinary genius of Auguste Escoffier. I recall saying, with a certain… *panache*: \"Inspired by Auguste Escoffier, *Langue d’agneau en Papillote* served with a sauce of duxelle and oyster mushrooms, picked myself.\" A rather chatty lamb, indeed.
