                         Do you want a cup of coffee? And

    WILL GRAHAM

                         Let’s have a cup of coffee. Or

    Will smiles at her bulldogishness in his defense.

                         You can’t be her for everyone. Don’t
                         have to draw a line, but you might
                         want to know where your line is.

=== 6 EXT. WILL GRAHAM’S HOUSE - PATIO - EARLY MORNING 2 ===

               WILL GRAHAM steps out onto his porch in boxers and a t-shirt,
               hair tussled from recently getting out of bed. He’s followed
               by his PACK OF DOGS. The pooches bound down the stairs toward
               the driveway and Will suddenly realizes he’s not alone.

               CAMERA FINDS ALANA BLOOM stepping out of her car to greet the
               dogs as they return the favor. She smiles at Will.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Morning.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I didn’t hear you drive up.
                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Hybrid.  Good car for stalking.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I’m compelled to go cover myself.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         I have brothers.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I’ll put on a robe just the same.
                         Do you want a cup of coffee? And
                         more immediately why are you here?
                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Yes.  And Abigail Hobbs woke up.

               Will stops in his tracks.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         You know how to bury the lead.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Want me to get you a cup of coffee?
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         No, I want to get my coat.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Let’s have a cup of coffee. Or

               RINGS and finally stops.

                         Is he going to keep calling?

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Jack wants you to go see her.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         And you don’t.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Eventually. Could help to take a
                         step back before a step forward.
                                   WILL GRAHAM

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         When you see Abigail, and I do
                         think you should see her, I want it
                         to be on your terms. I want you to
                         get what you need. I want Abigail
                         to get what she needs. What Jack
                         needs, I’m not as concerned about.

               Will smiles at her bulldogishness in his defense.
                                   ALANA BLOOM (CONT’D)
                         I don’t want to get in the middle
                         of you and Jack, but if I can be
                         helpful to you as a buffer...

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I like you as a buffer. I also
                         like the way you rattle Jack.
                         He respects you too much to yell at
                         you no matter how much he wants to.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         And I take advantage of that.
               Will turns the subject back to what he’s most concerned with.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Abigail Hobbs doesn’t have anyone.

               She considers how to respond to that, then:

                         When I said what I was going to say
                         in my head, it sounded insulting.
                         I’ll find another way to say it.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Say it the insulting way.

                         I get it. I can trust a dog to be
                         a dog, but I can’t trust Abigail

                         The first person Abigail talks to
                         about what happened can’t be anyone

               onto the several SHOPPING BAGS she’s carrying.

               Alana enters as quietly as possible, given the circumstances,
               to find ABIGAIL HOBBS sitting up in bed, reading a book,
               exhausted, vacant, looking like she just woke up from a coma.
                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Hi.  I’m Alana Bloom.
                                                                                    
               Alana unloads the shopping bags on the couch.

                         Not medicine. I’m a psychiatrist.

                         What do you specialize in?

                         I asked the nurses if my parents
                         were dead and they wouldn’t tell
                         me.  Said I had to wait for you.
                                                                                    
               Alana sits on the edge of Abigail’s bed.
                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         I’m sorry you had to wait.

               Alana studies her and the strange admission. Abigail’s chin
               crumples with emotion but she fights it.

                         I have 7 families waiting, let me
                         rephrase, demanding that we find
                         whatever’s left of their daughters.
                         Abigail Hobbs is the only person I
                         can ask who might know the truth.
    

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         You can’t ask her right now. We
                         have to create a safe place for her
                         first or you won’t get any answers.
    

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         I respect your sympathy for her,
                         Doctor Bloom. One day I hope
                         you’ll appreciate my lack of it.
    

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         I have some appreciation.

                         Only body we found is the one Hobbs
                         didn’t eat. 7 bodies.  7 girls.
    

                                   HANNIBAL
                         7 sisters, in Abigail’s mind. When
                         she learns of her father’s crimes.
    

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         May already know about them. Her
                         DNA’s all over his slaughterhouse.
    

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         You really think Abigail helped her
                         father kill those girls?
    

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         It is one possibility that needs to
                         be ruled out. If she didn’t help
                         her father, she may know who did.
    

                                   HANNIBAL
                             (to Alana)
                         How was Abigail? When you saw her?
    

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Surprisingly practical.
    

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Suspiciously practical?
    

                                   HANNIBAL
                         I would suggest she can be
                         practical without being a murderer.
    

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         I think she’s hiding something.
    

                                   HANNIBAL
                         It may simply be her trauma.
    

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Yes. Could also be more. She has a
                         penchant for manipulation, withheld
                         information to gain information.
                         She demonstrated only enough
                         emotions to prove she had them.
    

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Appreciating my lack of sympathy?
    

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Providing psychological evaluation.
    

                                   HANNIBAL
                         You said it may be more than trauma
                         yet you question her involvement in
                         the murders her father committed.
    

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         What I’m questioning is her state
                         of mind. She repeated something I
                         said when she was... unconscious.
    

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Leading you to believe she wasn’t.
    

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Leading me to believe it was odd.
    

                                   HANNIBAL
                         It is odd, but not unheard of for
                         the comatose or anesthetized to
                         recall word for word conversations
                         that took place in their presence.
    

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         I want Will Graham to talk to her.
    

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Jack.  Not yet.
    

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Doctor Bloom, you’re not Will’s
                         psychiatrist. Doctor Lecter is.
    

                                   HANNIBAL
                         For intents and purposes, yes, but
                         I’m not entirely objective on this.
                         Will and I share a compassion for
                         Abigail Hobbs, we saved her life.
    

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Then who better to create a safe
                         place for her to answer questions.
    

                                   WILL GRAHAM (V.O.)
                         Garret Jacob Hobbs abducted and
                         murdered eight girls over an eight
                         month period. They each had the
                         same hair color. Same eye color.

                         Didn’t seem real. He was loving

                         wasn’t.  He kept telling me he was                         
                         sorry and to just hold still. He

                         nothing wrong with you. You said                           
                         he was loving. I believe it.

               Abigail takes Will’s words in for a brief moment, then:              
                                   ABIGAIL

               Freddie Lounds leans on the hood of Hannibal’s midnight blue
               Bentley, waiting. She spots Hannibal and Will as they
               approach and quickly stands, almost respectfully.

                         Special Agent Graham, I never
                         formally introduced myself.
                             (offers her hand to Will)
                         I’m Freddie Lounds.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Trying to salvage this joke from
                         the mouth of madness?
                                   FREDDIE LOUNDS
                         Please.  Let me apologize for my
                         behavior in there. It was sloppy
                         and misguided. And hurtful.

                         Miss Lounds, now isn’t the time.
                                   FREDDIE LOUNDS
                         Look, you and I may have our own
                         reasons for being here, but I also
                         think we both genuinely care what
                         happens to Abigail Hobbs.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         You told her I was insane.
                                   FREDDIE LOUNDS
                         I can un-do that.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         You help Abigail see me as more
                         than her father’s killer and I help
                         you with online ad sales?
                                   FREDDIE LOUNDS
                         I can un-do what I said. I can
                         also make it a lot worse.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Miss Lounds, it’s not very smart to
                         piss off a guy who thinks about
                         killing people for a living.
               Hannibal sighs at Will’s unfortunate choice of words.

                         Will killed her father to save her                         
                         life.  If she sees Will as her                             
                         savior and he doesn’t meet her                             
                         expectations, she could transfer                           
                         rage toward her father onto him.

               As Will, Hannibal and Alana look on, Abigail stares at the           
               faded rust-colored stain on the front step, where her mother         
               died, her eyes brimming with tears but not overflowing.

                         alive and taken to the hospital                            
                         before they finish the crime scene.                        
               Those words wash over Abigail, she’s barely aware of them.

               Abigail and Marissa walk the stream that runs like a scar
               through the yard. Marissa nods at Abigail’s bandaged neck.

                         watching Applejack and Twilight and
                         they don’t scream like that. And
                         then there was all this shooting.

               Marissa picks up a rock and throws it at Nick. He sidesteps
               to avoid her stone, continues to harass.

               Marissa throws another rock, striking Nick across his
               forehead, leaving a small gash. He stumbles, briefly
               silenced.  When he looks up, clutching his bloody head wound,
               his looks right at Marissa, murder in his eyes...

                   inconspicuously kicks a few dead leaves to cover the stone.

                   of silence, his circulatory system humming in his ear, then a        
                   subtle crunching of grass indicates Will is not alone.               
    

    Will stares at the beast, then cuts Abigail’s throat.                
    

    ARTERIAL SPRAY peppers the grass in large drops. A horrible

=== 25 EXT. HOBBS RESIDENCE - ACROSS THE STREAM - MOMENTS LATER  25 ===

                                                                                    
               Hannibal and Will stomp through the forest, returning from           
               looking for Nick Boyle.                                              
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         He’s gone.                                                 
                                                                                    
               Hannibal’s eyes fall to a bloodied rock on the embankment            
               near the stream. As he turns to meet Will, his foot                  
               inconspicuously kicks a few dead leaves to cover the stone.

                         You’ve never seen him before?

                         No.  Have you?                                             
               Will shakes his head “no.”

=== 26 EXT. WILL GRAHAM’S HOUSE - DAY - DREAMSCAPE               26 ===

               SLOW MOTION. Will stands outside his home, an eerie moment           
               of silence, his circulatory system humming in his ear, then a        
               subtle crunching of grass indicates Will is not alone.               
                                                                                    
               He glances over to see...                                            
                                                                                    
               A BLACK STAG                                                         
                                                                                    
               It walks quietly through the meadow toward Will, who holds           
               his breath, taking in the surreal vision of this beast. The          
               BLACK STAG stops and watches Will.

               He is now holding ABIGAIL HOBBS with a knife to her throat.          
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         I’m sorry, Abigail. Please just                            
                         hold still. Please.  I’m going to                          
                         make it all go away.

               Will stares at the beast, then cuts Abigail’s throat.                
               ARTERIAL SPRAY peppers the grass in large drops. A horrible          
               tone pierces the air as the BLACK STAG BOLTS.

               The DOOR OPENS and Abigail steps inside as Will wads up the
               CRIME SCENE TAPE.

                         He cleaned everything. He said he
                         was afraid of germs but I guess he
                         was just afraid of getting caught.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         No one else ever came up here with

                                   ABIGAIL
                         He made everything by himself.
                         Plumbing putty, glue, butter. He
                         sold the pelts on ebay or in town.
                         He made pillows. Carved knives out

                         It’s very likely.

               Abigail crosses to the gutting/skinning table.

                         Before he cut my throat, he told me
                         he killed those girls so he
                         wouldn’t have to kill me.

                         If he would have just killed me,
                         none of those girls would be dead.

               PLIP.  A single drop of blood falls from the ceiling onto
               Abigail’s cheek. She wipes it off with her fingertip and
               stares at it a brief moment before glancing up.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK OFF OF Will, Hannibal and Alana as they
               stare at something horrifying. Will speaks to his phone:

               A YOUNG WOMAN hangs naked, impaled on a RACK OF ANTLERS.
               Will approaches and slowly lifts the young woman’s head.

               It’s MARISSA. Abigail has climbed the stairs behind Hannibal
               and Alana. Her eyes go wide, realizing what has happened.

               along the cabin, barely staying ahead of a POLICE OFFICER
               unspooling a temporary barricade of YELLOW POLICE TAPE.

               Abigail is being comforted by Alana along the edge of the
               woods as the CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATORS move in and out of the
               HOBBS CABIN. An F.B.I. S.U.V. barrels down the dirt road.

                         cannibal? Abigail.  Anything to                            
                         say to the families of your

               Abigail and her escorts walk toward the Hobbs Residence,             
               while their eyes regard the Police Line. They finally look           
               away just as Marissa’s Mother pushes her way through the             
               crowd.  A POLICEMAN awkwardly tries to hold her back.                
                                                                                    
               Like a paternal shield, Hannibal eases Abigail toward Alana          
               and steps to intercept Marissa’s Mother. He bars her path,           
               grips her arms, his hands soft but firm.                             
                                   MARISSA’S MOTHER                                 
                         Why come back? Why did you come                            
                         back here? Why did you come back?                          
                                                                                    
               Abigail can’t find her words. Marissa’s Mother is so wracked         
               with grief she can barely stand. A Policeman arrives behind          
               her as Alana moves in, easing her from Hannibal’s hold.

                         Miss Lounds, you’re on the wrong                           
                         side of the police line.

                         This is my tale to tell. I’ve been                         
                         covering the Minnesota Shrike long                         
                         before you got involved.                                   
                                                                                    
               But Hannibal and a POLICE OFFICER are already approaching.           
                                                                                    
               The Police Officer grabs Freddie by the elbow, ushering her          
               away from the Hobbs House and Abigail. She calls out:                
                                   FREDDIE LOUNDS (CONT’D)

               Abigail sits on the couch, crying quietly, emotionally               
               exhausted from the horrors of the day.                               
               INCLUDE A HANDMADE PILLOW.                                            
                                                                                    
               Embroidered across the surface, an image of a DEER walks             
               across a plain, trimmed in pelt. She clutches it to her              
               stomach, needing something to hold. Then it dawns on her.            
                                                                                    
               Abigail’s hands gnarl as she begins pulling at the fabric of         
               the pillow, digging her fingernails into it. The pillow              
               begins to rip at the seams and Abigail tears it open.                
                                                                                    
               She begins to shake before CAMERA REVEALS she’s removed the          
               pillow’s stuffing. WADS AND WADS AND WADS OF HUMAN HAIR.             
               Abigail’s heartbeat POUNDS IN HER EARS, filling her head with        
               a rhythmic, oppressive TONE. She begins to tremble.                  
               As Abigail reels from this horror, there’s A BLUR OF MOTION          
               unbeknownst to her in front of the sliding glass doors.              
                                                                                    
               A slight BREEZE blows through Abigail’s hair and SOUND               
               RETURNS TO NORMAL. She looks up to see the sliding glass             
               doors are NOW OPEN. Standing in front of her: NICK BOYLE.        
                                                                                    
                                   NICK BOYLE                                       
                         I’m not going to hurt you. I got                           
                         to talk to someone. I didn’t kill                          
                         that girl. I swear I didn’t.                               
               Abigail instinctively goes still. Then BOLTS. Abigail                
               attempts to run. Nick Boyle grabs her, spins her around and          
               forces her against the wall, his hand over her mouth.

               rouse her out of a deep sleep. His voice is gentle, fatherly.

                         Sometimes at night, I leave the
                         lights on in my little house and
                         walk across the flat fields. When
                         I look back from a distance, the

                         things at various times of the day.
                         Like I was eating or showering or

                   scribbles in Will’s PATIENT NOTEBOOK, adding to observations.
    

                   A CREEK from the balcony above him lifts his pen from page.

                         Hospital called. You climbed over

                         go?  Home is no longer an option.
                             (then)
                         Come down from there.
    

               Abigail climbs down the ladder, taking Hannibal’s hand for
               balance as she steps off the last rungs onto the floor.
    

                                   ABIGAIL
                         I don’t want to go to sleep.

                         I didn’t honor any part of him. So
                         it’s just murder, isn’t it?

                         still be those who would say you
                         were taking after your father.
    

                                   ABIGAIL

                         Like your father, you know the
                         unreality of the people who die.
                         You understand that they are not
                         flesh, but light and air and color.
                         Quick sounds quickly ended when you
                         change them. You changed Nicholas
                         Boyle like a burst balloon.
               A wave of near-nausea washes over her, she pushes it down.

                         Nicholas Boyle is more important
                         for the gutting, more important
                         than the life he clamored after.
                                   ABIGAIL
                         You’re glad I killed him.
                                   HANNIBAL
                         What would be the alternative?
                         That he killed you?
    

                                   ABIGAIL
                         I don’t know if he was going to.
                                   HANNIBAL
                         No, you don’t.
                                   ABIGAIL
                         You’re the one who called the
                         house.  You talked to my dad
                         before... What did you say to him?
    

                                   HANNIBAL
                         A simple conversation, ascertaining
                         if he was home for an interview.
                             (off her look)
                         Then why not tell the truth?
                                   ABIGAIL
                         They think who called the house was
                         a serial killer. Just like my dad.
                                   HANNIBAL
                         I’m nothing like your father. I
                         made a mistake. Something easily
                         misconstrued. Not unlike yourself.
                             (then)
                         I’ll keep your secret.

                         And I’ll keep yours.
               There’s a finality to their agreement. A life long pact.

=== 43 INT. HANNIBAL’S OFFICE - LATER THAT NIGHT 5               43 ===

                   Hannibal works quietly at his desk in his darkened space. He
                   scribbles in Will’s PATIENT NOTEBOOK, adding to observations.

                   A CREEK from the balcony above him lifts his pen from page.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Hello, Abigail.

                                                                (CONTINUED)

               CAMERA REVEALS Abigail standing on the second floor library.

                                   ABIGAIL
                         How did you know it was me?
                                   HANNIBAL
                         Hospital called. You climbed over
                         the wall. Where else were you to
                         go?  Home is no longer an option.
                             (then)
                         Come down from there.

               Abigail climbs down the ladder, taking Hannibal’s hand for
               balance as she steps off the last rungs onto the floor.

                                   ABIGAIL
                         I don’t want to go to sleep.
                                   HANNIBAL
                         You can’t anticipate your dreams,
                         can’t block them, can’t repress.

                                   ABIGAIL
                         I didn’t honor any part of him. So
                         it’s just murder, isn’t it?
                                   HANNIBAL
                         Most would argue self defense.

                                   ABIGAIL
                         Then why not tell the truth.
                                   HANNIBAL
                         Most would argue. There would
                         still be those who would say you
                         were taking after your father.

                                   ABIGAIL
                         Am I?
                                   HANNIBAL
                         Like your father, you know the
                         unreality of the people who die.

                         change them. You changed Nicholas
                         Boyle like a burst balloon.
               A wave of near-nausea washes over her, she pushes it down.
