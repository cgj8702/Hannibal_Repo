                         I feel my nerves clicking like
                         roller coaster cogs pulling up to
                         the inevitable long plunge.

                         Abigail ended Nicholas Boyle like a
                         burst balloon. She took a life.

                         You’re grieving, Will. Not for the
                         life you have taken, but for the
                         life that was taken from you.
                             (off his look)
                         If Abigail could have started over,
                         left the horror of her father
                         behind, so could’ve you. You could
                         untangle yourself from the madness
                         and the murder, clear your mind.

                         We both know the unreality of
                         taking a life, of people who die
                         when we have no other choice. We
                         know in those moments they’re not
                         flesh, but light and air and color.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Isn’t that what it is to be alive.

                         Do you feel alive, Will?

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I feel like I’m fading.

                         Have you experienced any further
                         loss of time... or hallucinations.
               A slow, quiet nod.

                         I’d like you to draw a clock face.
                         Numbered. Large hand indicating
                         the hour, small hand the minute.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Why?
                                   HANNIBAL
                         An exercise. Nothing more.  I want
                         you to remember a present moment.
                         The now. Often as you can, think
                         of where you are and when.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         This feels like you’re tying
                         mittens to my coat sleeves.

                         Indulge me.
               Hannibal hands Will a notebook and pen. Will quickly draws a
               circle, numbers, with the clock hands indicating the time is
               just after 7:15 PM. From Will’s P.O.V., A NORMAL CLOCK.

                         Think of the time. Think of where
                         you are. Think of who you are.

                         It’s 7:16 PM. I’m in Baltimore,
                         Maryland. My name is Will Graham.

                         A simple reminder. A handle to
                         reality for you to hold onto.

                                   INCLUDE THE NOTEBOOK

                                   The CLOCK Will Graham has drawn is a circle with all of the
                                   numbers and hands stacked on one side. The other side of the
                                   circle is completely empty. Crowded numbers are Dahli-esque.

                                   THIS IS NOT A NORMAL CLOCK. Something is wrong with Will.

               A lonely house sits far from the main road, far from the
               hustle and bustle of city life.

               CLOSE ON A GARDEN GNOME

               Made of graying cement, its face and hands are lifted skyward
               as it stands among the bramble. Half its smiling face is
               missing.  The other half is streaked with filth and dirt.

               BETH LEBEAU

               Eases out of her car. She’s 30s, with natural, easy beauty.
               CAMERA TRACKS BETH toward her front door, lamps strung in the
               towering pine trees providing a SPOOKY BACK-LIGHT to the
               surrounding woods. She glances at the GARDEN SHED at the end
               of the driveway, its doors closed against the weather.

               THE HOUSE

               A ramshackle turn-of-the-century Victorian. Beth slogs the
               remaining steps to the door and takes out the key.

               Beth pours birdseed into a small container in a canary cage,
               whistling as she invites the bird to do the same.
               The canary SINGS.


=== 5 EXT. WOODED HOUSE -- BACKYARD - NIGHT 1                  5 ===

               CAMERA FINDS the weathered GARDEN SHED.

               In the utter blackness, CAMERA SLOWLY PUSHES IN ON THE SHED
               as RAIN begins to spatter through its NOW OPEN DOORS.

               CLOSER and CLOSER we PUSH IN on the OPEN DOORS.


=== 6 INT. WOODED HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 1 (LATER)            6 ===

               The house is comfy, the bedroom decorated with equestrian
               mementoes and photos of Beth’s friends and family. Beth
               ENTERS dressed for bed, snuggles under the covers as the WIND
               and RAIN create havoc outside. Drowsy. Her FINGERS reach
               for the switch on the bedside lamp. She clicks it off --

               BLACKNESS. It envelopes us.  A small THUD from up above.
               Beth turns on the lamp. She stares --

               UP AT THE CEILING

               Drip, drip, drip. Slow motion.  Small POOLS OF WATER seep
               through the planked ceiling.
               A SERIES OF WET POOLS form in haphazard order. One after
               another.  Almost like footsteps. A roof leak maybe?

               BETH yanks off the covers. What now?   She reaches into her
               bedside table to retrieve a FLASHLIGHT.


=== 7 INT. WOODED HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 1                    7 ===

               Beth reaches for a small cord that dangles from the ceiling.

               THE CEILING LADDER
               Swings down. Beth manages to navigate the steps with
               flashlight in hand. The sound of SWIRLING WIND floats down
               from above, a sudden blast of cold air.

               She CLIMBS the attic ladder. Curious.

               The FLASHLIGHT BEAM illumines dusty boxes and broken
               furniture, casting strange shadows as Beth moves stealthily
               through the attic, eyes keen, flashlight swiveling. She
               shivers against the cold. Then understands why:
               HER P.O.V. - A PORTION OF THE ROOF

               Has COLLAPSED INWARD under the weight of snow. Snow and
               water commingle on the attic floor, presumably the source of
               the strange “water pools” on her bedroom ceiling.


=== 9 EXT. HOUSE - ROOF - NIGHT 1                              9 ===

               CAMERA PULLS BACK from Beth inside looking through the hole
               to REVEAL FOOTPRINTS in the snow, darting across the roof.

=== 10 INT. WOODED HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT 1                     10 ===

               A STAPLE GUN

               K’CHUK, K’CHUK, K’CHUK. Beth staples a TARP over the
               entrance of the hole in the roof.

               EMPTY PAILS

               Beth strategically places them beneath the leaking roof. For
               the moment, problem solved. Time for bed.

=== 11 INT. WOODED HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 1                   11 ===

               Beth enters from the hall with her flashlight. She freezes           
               in place.  In a lazy path from the DOORWAY TO HER BED are            
               more POOLS OF WATER. Her shoulders slump. This old house.            
                                                                                    
               CAMERA TRACKS OVER THE “WET POOLS,” which are amorphous              
               puddles until the final one before her bed.                          
               A WET HUMAN FOOTPRINT.                                               
                                                                                    
               REVERSING, BETH STARES at the footprint. Weird. Maybe even           
               a bit scary. But the bed is empty.  And a woman who lives            
               alone in the woods doesn’t scare easy.                               
                                                                                    
               She follows the trail of footprint shaped puddles of water to

               A GNARLED HAND from under the bed grabs Beth’s leg, yanking          
               her to the floor. She SCREAMS as she’s pulled into the               
               darkness under the bed; but the scream turns to a wet gurgle

               house.  Will walks out the kitchen door, drying his hands.           
                                                                                    
               A quiet moment, then:

                             (then)
                         I’m going to ask you a question and
                         if I think for a moment you’re
                         withholding anything from me, I
                         cannot guarantee a calm response.
                         What happened in there?
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I got confused.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         I’ve seen you confused before.
                         I’ve seen you upset. I’ve never
                         seen you afraid like you were.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I’m an old hand at fear. I can
                         manage this one. I was just
                         disoriented. I can go back in.
                                                                                    
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         I saw your face when you walked out
                         of that room. What you experienced
                         in there stunned you silent.
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I can see and hear better afraid.
                         Just can’t speak as concisely.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         You contaminated the crime scene.
                                                                                    
               Will stops dodging and finally admits:
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I thought I was responsible for it.
                                                                                    
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         You thought you killed that woman?
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Sometimes with what I do --
                                                                                    
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         What you do is take whatever
                         evidence there is and extrapolate.
                         You reconstruct the thinking of a
                         killer, not think you are a killer.
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I got lost in the reconstruction.
                         Just for a second. Just a blink.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         I know you don’t like to be a
                         subject of concern, but consider me
                         officially concerned.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Officially.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         That’s right.

                         Thought the reason you have me
                         seeing Dr. Lecter and not an FBI
                         psychiatrist is so my mental well-
                         being stays unofficial.
               The truth of that stings more than Jack anticipated.

                         Do you have anybody that does this
                         better unbroken than I do broken?

               damaged beyond the simple recognition of fractured smiles.

                         You must overcome these delusions                          
                         that are disguising your reality.

                         It wasn’t savage. It was lonely...                         
                         desperate... sad.

                         I caught a glimpse of myself in the                        
                         mirror.  I looked through me, past                         
                         me.  Like I was a stranger.

                         You have to honestly confront your                         
                         limitations with what you do and                           
                         how it affects you.

                         If by limitations you mean the                             
                         difference between sanity and                              
                         insanity... I don’t accept that.

                         I know what kind of crazy I am and                         
                         this is not that kind of crazy.                            
                         This could be seizures. This could                         
                         be a tumor. A blood clot.

                         I can recommend a neurologist.

                         you have to accept what you’re                             
                         struggling with is mental illness.

               Will and Hannibal are seated in the swank office of DR.              
               DONALD SUTCLIFFE, 40’s, a vain and brilliant man who treats          
               others rudely unless he respects them. Thus Hannibal                 
               receives the utmost professional courtesy.

                         You’re in very good hands. Dr.                             
                         Lecter is the sanest man I know.

                         I would agree.

                         Dr. Sutcliffe and I were residents                         
                         together at Hopkins.

                         Another life ago. When you didn’t                          
                         mind getting your hands dirty.

                         I was always drawn to how the mind                         
                         works.  I found it much more                               
                         dynamic than how the brain works.                          
                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE                                    
                         The projected image is more                                
                         interesting than the projector                             
                         until the projector breaks down.

                         Not that I’m aware of.

                         I guess we’ll find out. How about                          
                         accidents, head traumas? Even if                           
                         you’ve had a slip and fall?

               like he’s trapped inside a metal coffin.

               Dr. Sutcliffe and Hannibal study a monitor depicting the
               ANIMATED BRAIN SCAN, as well as the standard “three-slice”
               scans on multiple control room screens.

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE
                         The entire right side of his brain
                         is inflamed. It’s Anti-NMDA
                         receptor encephalitis. Symptoms
                         are going to get a lot worse.

                         I know.  It’s unfortunate for Will.

               Dr. Sutcliffe shows Will his perfectly normal brain scans.

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE
                         We didn’t find anything abnormal.
                         No vascular malformations, no
                         tumors.  No swelling or bleeding.
                         No evidence of stroke. Nothing
                         wrong with you neurologically.

               Sutcliffe studies Will’s troubled face.

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                         Usually when I tell a patient that,
                         they’re happy to hear it.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         So... what I’m experiencing is
                         psychological?

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE
                         Brain scans can’t diagnose a mental
                         disorder. They can only rule out
                         medical illnesses, like a tumor,
                         that can cause similar symptoms.

               Will is definitely not happy.

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE (CONT’D)
                         We’ll do some more tests. Take
                         some blood samples, but I imagine
                         they’ll be just as inconclusive.

                         mirror neurons. Our heads are

                         held onto his, which makes knowing

                         It’s a mild form of echopraxia.

                         Jack, the very air has screams                             
                         smeared on it. In those places, he                         
                         doesn’t just reflect, he absorbs.                          
               Will Graham eases out of his car.

               He treads toward Beth LeBeau’s lonely house in the woods.            
                                                                                    
               CAMERA TRACKS WILL, trudging toward the house. He tears the          
               CRIME SCENE TAPE from the door and enters.                           
                                                                                    

               Will ENTERS, glances around, notices the bird cage is empty.         
                                                                                    

               Will walks slowly into the dark bedroom. He turns on the             
               lamp on the night stand. Replaying the recollections in his          
               head.  The stain from the murder still coats the floor.              
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         It’s 10:36 PM. I’m in Greenwood,                           
                         Delaware. My name is Will Graham.                          
                                                                                    
               He edges toward the bed.                                             
                                                                                    
               He crouches as CAMERA ARMS DOWN to find --                           
                                                                                    
               A PAIR OF EYES staring at him from beneath the bed.                  
                                                                                    
               Will’s frozen. Dream or reality?  When suddenly --                   
               THE BED OVERTURNS TOWARD HIM                                         
                                                                                    
               The lamp on the night stand is SMASHED. In the FLASH of the          
               exploding bulb, a SHAPE darts past Will, a DEAD YOUNG WOMAN,         
               her skin yellowed and filthy, the whites of her eyes filled          
               with blood. It may as well be the walking corpse of Beth             
               LeBeau haunting Will’s waking nightmare of murdering her.            
                                                                                    
               But it’s not. Will grabs her by the elbow.

               With a sickening sound, a whole SHEATH OF SKIN PEELS OFF HER         
               ARM, leaving Will holding the macabre “glove.” Before Will’s

               CAMERA CIRCLES WILL, a sense of frightful dislocation. The
               WOODED HOUSE in the deep, deep background. There’s no sign           
               of the Dead Young Woman. Will looks at his watch and winces.

                         I called you because I’m not

                         I grabbed her arm and an entire
                         layer of dead skin separated from
                         the underlying tissue... like she
                         was wearing a glove.

                         That’s why she doesn’t bleed.

                         No circulation. There’s nothing
                         alive in the tissue to bind it.

                         What did you do with it.
    

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I don’t know.

                         Could be a severe staphylococcal

                         Her eyes were discolored. She was

                         might not even know she did it.

                         Then why did she come back?
    

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         To convince herself she didn’t.
    

                                   BEVERLY KATZ
                         Is that why you came back?

                         If I wasn’t clear on that issue, I
                         know I didn’t kill Beth Lebeau. I
                         just want to know who did.
    

                                   BEVERLY KATZ
                         Me, too.
                             (then)
                         You’re the subject of a lot of
                         speculation at the bureau.

                         What are they speculating?
    

                                   BEVERLY KATZ
                         That Jack pushed you right up to
                         the edge and now you’re pushing
                         yourself over.
    

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         This killer can’t accept her
                         reality. I can occasionally
                         identify with that. That being
                         said, I feel relatively sane.

                         It’s 7-oh-5 PM. I’m in Baltimore,
                         Maryland. My name is Will Graham.
    

               We are --
    

=== 43 INT. WOODED HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 3                   43 ===

                                                                                    
               Will and Beverly stand over the disheveled room.

                         Why did you call me? Why not Jack
                         Crawford? Why not the police?
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I called you because I’m not
                         entirely sure what I saw was real.
               That admission almost breaks her heart, but it doesn’t show.

                         Then let’s prove it.

                         I grabbed her arm and an entire
                         layer of dead skin separated from
                         the underlying tissue... like she
                         was wearing a glove.

                         That’s why she doesn’t bleed.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         No circulation. There’s nothing
                         alive in the tissue to bind it.

                         I don’t know.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Her eyes were discolored. She was
                         malnourished. Jaundiced.  Liver’s
                         shutting down. She was deranged.

                         When she was nine, she told me she
                         was thinking about killing me and
                         that she was already dead. Imagine

                         Older she got, the worse they got.
                         She had seizures, hallucinations,
                         psychotic depression. I was
                         grateful when she was catatonic.

                         Sometimes. We took precautions,
                         made plans. Georgia’s little
                         sister knew to lock herself in the
                         car at the first sign of trouble.

                         What did her doctors say?

                         Not much.

                         She’d stay in the hospital for
                         months at a time. A million
                         dollars of blood tests and brain
                         scans, all of them inconclusive.
               Will reacts to that, relating to her frustration.

                         I don’t have a million dollars.

                         They would say it was this or that,
                         but they were always guessing.

                         I did my own research, wrote down
                         every word all those doctors would
                         say, all the different terminology.
                         Learned a lot but mostly what I
                         learned was how little is actually
                         known about mental illness.
                             (then)
                         All they really know is it’s rarely

52 INT. B.A.U. - JACK CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - DAY 5

               Jack sits behind his desk, lost in thought, pouring over the
               case file on Georgia Madchen.

               CAMERA REVEALS Will standing in the doorway.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Managing your expectations?

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Changing my expectations.

                         After Miriam Lass died, I went to
                         pack up my office. Then the idea
                         of packing became so overwhelming I
                         thought I should just leave. I got
                         a trainee killed. It was a failure
                         of leadership. I was responsible.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         You didn’t kill Miriam Lass. The
                         Chesapeake Ripper did.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Doesn’t feel that way to me. I
                         pulled her out of a classroom like
                         I pulled you out of the classroom.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         She was a student. I’m a teacher.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Neither of you are real F.B.I.,
                         which means I’m as responsible for
                         you as much as I was for her.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I’ll take my own responsibility.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Not from me, you won’t. We’re
                         going to share that responsibility.
                             (beat)
                         I broke the rules for Miriam Lass.
                         Encouraged her to break the rules.
                         I’m breaking the rules with you.

                         Special Agent. Meaning you still
                         represent the F.B.I. Meaning you

                         No, but you’ve got me curious. Why
                         are you still here when you and I
                         both know this is bad for you.
                             (beat)
                         You had an opportunity to quit.
                         For some reason you didn’t take it.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Do you want me to quit?

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         I want you to know why I think you
                         didn’t quit. You’re still here
                         because what you do here has given
                         you some sense of stability. That
                         stability is good for you, Will.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Stability requires a strong
                         foundation, Jack. My moorings are
                         built in the sand.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         I am not sand. I am bedrock.  Even
                         when you are doubting yourself, you
                         don’t have to doubt me.

               Off Will, realizing he has an ally in Jack --

               Classical music plays. Dr. Sutcliffe and Hannibal consider a
               centerpiece of succulent ham still on the bone.

                         There is no equivalent.

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE
                         Still love your rare treats, don't
                         you, Hannibal? The more difficult
                         and expensive to obtain the better.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         It's a distinction that adds an
                         expectation of quality.

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE
                         Not always.

                         For Iberico, only a few pigs are
                         selected each year. Once chosen,
                         they roam the fields of Western
                         Spain, enjoying a diet of local
                         acorns and roots which give the ham
                         its distinct flavor. But is the
                         pig, once fattened and slaughtered
                         and air cured, superior to any
                         other pig, or is it simply a matter
                         of reputation preceding product?

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE
                         Irrelevant. If the meat-eater
                         believes it’s superior, belief
                         determines value.

                                   HANNIBAL

                         but referrals being better.

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE
                         We know how Iberico chooses his
                         pigs.  How did you choose yours?

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Are you referring to Will Graham?

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE
                         You’re fond of the rarefied. What
                         makes him so rare?

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Will Graham has a remarkably vivid
                         imagination. Beautiful.  Pure
                         empathy. Nothing he can’t
                         understand and that terrifies him.

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE
                         So you set his mind on fire.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Imagination is an interesting
                         accelerant for a fever.

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE
                         How far is this going to go? Put
                         out the fire or let him burn?

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Will’s my friend. We’ll put out
                         the fire. When it’s necessary.

                                   DR. SUTCLIFFE
                         He wants to have more tests.

                         It’ll be easier to hide from him.

               shirt as he shuffles toward Sutcliffe's Office. He slows to
               a stop once seeing an odd stain outside Sutcliffe’s door,
               which is partially ajar, an almost imperceptible speck of
               something that catches Will's eye.
               Then Will notices the burgundy smear on the door knob, as if
               someone pulled the door shut behind them and it didn’t latch.

                                     UNDER THE BED
        

               Will is strangely calm, cautious. He knows he’s not
               dreaming.  He puts his face close to the ground to peer under

=== 65 INT. WILL GRAHAM’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 65 ===

               WILL’S EYELIDS flicker.

               He glances over to see the dogs are all staring under the
               bed, their growls growing ever so gradually.

               Will leans over the side of the bed, pulling up the sheets,
               and looking under his mattress and box spring.

                                  WILL’S P.O.V. - GEORGIA MADCHEN

                                       ON WILL

               Nevertheless, he panics and tumbles off his mattress,
               scrambling away from the bed. The dogs BARK aggressively.

               Will positions himself between dogs and bed and commands:

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Tssst.  Stop.

               The dogs stop barking in various stages until all quiet, only
               the low-pitched rumble of growls ready when they’re summoned.
               Will is strangely calm, cautious. He knows he’s not
               dreaming.  He puts his face close to the ground to peer under
               the bed.

                                     UNDER THE BED

               In her grim visage we see not horror, but sadness. An ache.
               Georgia Madchen stares back, feral, silent.

                                   WILL GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                         I see you, Georgia.
               She scoots further into the shadows under the bed.

                                   WILL GRAHAM (CONT’D)
                         Think of who you are.

               The genuine need in Will’s statement calms Georgia.

               Will approaches a BURN TANK. Georgia’s visible through clear
               plastic, protected from the outside world. She is heavily
               sedated and her body has been coated with ANTISEPTIC GEL.
               The dead woman is on life support, her eyes are open but for
               all intents and purposes, she is unconscious.

                         Risk of infection is high. She’s
                         lost most of her vital fluids.
                         Even some bone mass. She’s being
                         treated like a burn victim.

INT. DR. SUTCLIFFE’S OFFICE - NIGHT - GEORGIA’S FLASHBACK 69

Georgia eases her ghostly way through Dr. Sutcliffe’s door.

From her vantage point, Georgia can only see a man’s back as
he works on the recently-deceased Dr. Sutcliffe. The man is
wearing a clear plastic suit over a traditional three-piece.
(NOTE: Even from behind, we will recognize from his hair
style and dress that this can only be HANNIBAL LECTER.)
Georgia is fascinated as the man works with a fierce grace,
lacerating Dr. Sutcliffe’s face in the familiar “Glascow
Smile” with the scissors. He stops, SNIFFS the air,
olfactory senses detecting Georgia’s decaying body. As he
turns...

face has absolutely no features. Face-less and
unrecognizable, Hannibal hands the scissors to Georgia.
