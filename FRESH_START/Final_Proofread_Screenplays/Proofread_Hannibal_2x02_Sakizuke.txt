               A SRI LANKAN MAN, dead clouded eyes staring, lies on his             
               side, naked in a pronounced question-mark posture.                   
               And he appears to SHUDDER... because the CORPSE SEWN SNUGLY          
               along the length of his back is MOVING AS WELL. But the              
               rejuvenation is an illusion, their movement created by --

               Alive, last seen coming to consciousness in Ep. #201,                
               desperately trying to free himself from this nightmare.              
                                                                                    
               The flesh of his left side, like the bodies around him,              
               shines with a coat of RESIN. But his legs, torn and                  
               bleeding, have been pulled free from the stitching.                  
               Only his arm stays anchored to the corpse beside him. With a         
               determined YANK, STITCHES SNAP, FLESH TEARS and Roland               
               SCREAMS.  The cry soars up into the huge cylinder he’s in.           
                                                                                    
               But Roland Umber is free.

               The SILO DOOR shakes and rattles against the paddle lock             
               securing it closed. Finally, bolts pop and the door swings           
               open, Roland Umber stumbling out into the night.                     
                                                                                    
               The night is dark, moonless, and all he can see are the dark         
               shapes and shadows of an old shed building and the hulking           
               corpses of old machinery and cars. The exterior of the silo          
               feels derelict, a junkyard, bounded by the whispering                
               blackness of a cornfield.                                            
               CAMERA FOLLOWS close behind Roland Umber who moves as best as        
               his resin-coated skin and his injuries allow. His head               
               swivels, searching, and then his EYES SQUINT at what looks           
               like the distant blinking lights of civilization. But it is:

               Suddenly, Roland is fixed in their glare, blinded and                
               bewildered. Puts an arm to his eyes to shade them.

               Blazing headlights suddenly hurtle toward him. He runs for:          
                                                                                    
               THE LABYRINTH OF ABANDONED CARS                                      
                                                                                    
               The PICKUP races toward him. As Roland dives behind old              
               metal, the pickup skids to a halt. The BRIGHT SPOTLIGHTS             
               aimed at the junkyard, transforming it into a contrasting            
               field of bright light and black shadows.                             
                                                                                    
               Roland Umber hunkers down behind a rusted-out car.                   
                                                                                    
               CAMERA FINDS the pickup as the driver’s door clunks open and         
               the KILLER steps out, loading a rifle. He walks in front of          
               his own headlights, scanning the junkyard in silhouette.             
               ON ROLAND                                                            
                                                                                    
               Behind him, the eye of the flashlight travels across the             
               empty cars, searching. He climbs inside an unlocked TERCEL,          
               narrowly escaping the BEAM of his Pursuer's torch.

               Winding through cars, led by his flashlight shining on the           
               Tercel's AERIAL ANTENNA which still SHUDDERS. The Pursuer's          
               hand grasps the car door handle, WRENCHES it open -- and we          
               see the OPPOSITE DOOR IS OPEN. Roland Umber is gone.                 
               Suddenly, the Killer swings round -- FLASHLIGHT flaring out          
               the LENS -- cornstalks still swinging where someone brushed          
               through them...

               The cornstalks tight and ominous around him. Breathless, he          
               watches as the FLASHLIGHT sweeps the corn, then points at him.       
                                                                                    
               He bolts, running away through the rows of corn.

               Roland Umber bursts out of the stalks and RUNS across the            
               open field, headed for a line of TREES.

               rings out and a nearby tree is hit by a bullet, spraying bark.       
               Roland keeps charging forward and disappears in the woods.
