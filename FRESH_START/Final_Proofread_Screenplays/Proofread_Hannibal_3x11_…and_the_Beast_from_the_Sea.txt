               Waves peak and reach for the moon, undulating on the surface.

               The waves swell and recede, pulled and played by the moon.

               Burnt orange, beautiful, full and fat, pulling at the earth.         
               Undulating with the surface of the sea, the moon wanes as the        
               shadow of Earth stretches across it, blanketing it in darkness.      
                                                                                    
               As the shadow moves, it reveals in its wake:

               He looks up to the sky; a trick of perspective makes the moon        
               huge in the FRAME, seemingly pressing down and into his head.

               Naked, he stares at the Blake painting of The Great Red              
               Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun. The roof over his head          
               bows and buckles, pushed and pulled by the power of the moon.        
                                                                                    
               CAMERA PULLS BACK from Dolarhyde as the tattoo tail wrapped          
               around his leg uncoils to the floor, no longer ink, but flesh.

               A shadow waxes over his face, slowly revealing, as the shadow        
               moves across him, that he is now --

                         He wanted you to meet the Dragon.                          
                         He nudged you in that direction.

                         minutes, if you don't mind.

               He flicks the remote switch and the projector begins. Light

EXT. FISHING CABIN - NIGHT

                                                                                    
               The full moon is bright and high in the sky. TRACK DOWN to           
               the cabin silhouetted below, amid the snow and trees.                
                                                                                    
               Orange light burns in the windows. Flames from the fire flicker.     
               Molly and Walter pass back and forth before the windows.

               He watches them calmly. Patient now.  The warm light from            
               the house plays on his face. And then disappears as the              
               lights go out.

               A terrifying smile as he looks to the now-darkened cabin. It         
               is almost time...

               shoulder like a friend, sending him into silhouette.

INT. FISHING CABIN - BEDROOM - NIGHT

               Molly wakes up. Some sixth sense pinging in her brain.               
                                                                                    
               The darkness of the bedroom envelopes her, moonlight throwing        
               shadows of the trees against the walls. Molly looks to an            
               alarm monitor on the wall, blinking a reassuring green.              
                                                                                    
               The light goes dead.                                                 
                                                                                    
               Fear slams into Molly, which she controls. She peers into            
               the darkness of the room, ears straining. As Molly slides            
               from the bed...

               ON WALTER, asleep. Molly rouses him gently, leaning in so he         
               can see her. As he comes to, she puts her finger to her lips         
               and Walter nods.

               coat and shoes, throwing tense glances toward the door.              
               She moves to a window and pulls back the drapes, revealing a         
               small dormer window set against the pitch of the roof.               
                                                                                    
               Molly carefully unlatches the window, as Walter looks on, and        
               slowly pushes it open. It jams on ice frozen in the frame.           
               Molly throws glances back toward the closed door, fighting           
               her desperation.
