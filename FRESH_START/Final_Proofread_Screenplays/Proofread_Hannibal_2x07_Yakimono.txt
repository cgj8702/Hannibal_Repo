                         I remember a dream about drowning.                         
                         Then being awake. And not awake.                           
                         Being myself, and not myself. I                            
                         remember I could smell salt air. We                        
                         were by the sea. For weeks.  Months.                       
                         Longer.  Days and evenings blurred,                        
                         I'd wake up to the smell of fresh                          
                         flowers and the sting of a needle.

                         I wasn't afraid. Fear and pain                             
                         were so far away, on the horizon,                          
                         but not close. Never close.

                         Even when he took my arm. He told                          
                         me what he was going to do. I went                         
                         to sleep. I woke up, it was gone.                          
                         Said he was giving it to you.

               looks at him intently. As if they could touch.

                         Abel Gideon has been playing his

                         There's no bargaining with smoke.

                         So if Hannibal kills me, he'll look                        
                         more suspicious? Or are you simply                         
                         suggesting I kill my career before                         
                         Hannibal can kill me?

                         I'm suggesting you convince Jack                           
                         Crawford however you can. Like

=== ? INT. BSHCI - THERAPY HALL - DAY ===

               Will comes through the doors under the guards' pulpit and            
               into the main hall. Sunlight shines through the windows,             
               creating shafts of light and shadow. Will walks toward               
               freedom, pausing to look at the brutal THERAPY CAGES where he        
               spent so much time. Walking down the hall, through the pools         
               of light, he realizes Jack Crawford is waiting for him,              
               standing near the base of the stairs. Will stops short.
