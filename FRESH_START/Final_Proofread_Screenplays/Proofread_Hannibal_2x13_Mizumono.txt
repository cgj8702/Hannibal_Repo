=== 15 INT. JACK CRAWFORD'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY ===

               Her light is dimming, but she remains radiant as sunlight            
               pools around the room between blocks of shadow. A portable

                         Forgiveness is such a profound,                            
                         emotional, conscious and                                   
                         unconscious state of affairs, we

                         There is no forgiving as a verb, as                        
                         an act that you can actually                               
                         execute. It simply happens to you.

                         for me, Freddie, or rather, don't.
