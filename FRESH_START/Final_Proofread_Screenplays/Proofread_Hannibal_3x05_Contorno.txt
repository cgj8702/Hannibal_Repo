               chairs beside the window with a table, bunk beds and a small         
               bathroom.  Old wood. A taste of a Europe from days gone by.          
               The train's RATTLE and CLACK is a constant background.

                         charming, a small cub that grows up

                         Murasaki when I was just a girl. I                         
                         learned from Hannibal, too. He had                         
                         all the wisdom in miniature.

                         but it's distress that excites him.

                         I've never been to Italy. I never                          
                         expected to. Birds eat thousands                           
                         of snails every day. Some of those                         
                         snails survive digestion and emerge                        
                         to find they've traveled the world.

               Chiyoh stares at Will, then her attention drifts back to the         
               window and the passing landscape. As CAMERA pushes through           
               the window, the landscape is revealed to be...

               Something is moving beyond a membrane. The shape is alien and        
               unnerving.  The membrane splits and the creature within              
               emerges.  A brutal, biting head and a long body -- horrific.

               Jack walks to the center of the bridge, the Arno River               
               stretching in either direction. The Ponte Vecchio downriver          
               from him.                                                            
                                                                                    
               We now see Jack carries an URN, and he rests it on the edge          
               of the bridge.                                                       
                                                                                    
               Watches sunlight dance on the water. A wistful smile.                
               And then Jack lifts the lid from the urn, dips in a hand and         
               lifts out Bella's ashes.                                             
                                                                                    
               CLOSE -- as some escape on the light breeze. He leans out            
               and drops them into the water. Watches as they dapple the            
               surface and disappear.                                               
                                                                                    
               Another handful. And then another.  And then he tips the urn         
               and the ashes fall in a sudden rush to the water below...
