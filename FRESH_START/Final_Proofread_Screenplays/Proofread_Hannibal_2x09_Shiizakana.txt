=== EXT. WOODS – EARLY MORNING ===

               Standing, his breath coming in frosted clouds. He stands             
               above a rope loosely coiled on the ground. We follow it to --

               Standing in the snow, tied securely to the base of a maple           
               tree.  The rope is looped around his throat, pulling his head        
               tight to the tree, and then continues in multiple turns              
               around his torso before leading back to Will.

                         Which answer is it you want to                             
                         hear, Will?

                         What’s happening now and about to                          
                         happen is an answer. I want an                             
                         admission. Admit what you are.

                         Must I denounce myself as a monster                        
                         while you still refuse to see the                          
                         one growing inside you?                                    
               Not the answer Will wants. He WHISTLES and the rope begins to        
               uncoil until it SNAPS taut, three feet off the ground. The           
               rope goes taut and, with it, the coils around Hannibal CREAK         
               as they tighten, slowly rolling round him like a python's            
               coils, until finally the rope tightens on his throat. Will           
               turns and now we see the rope leads several feet to --

               Facing away from Hannibal, leaning, but not pulling, waiting         
               docilely for direction.

               He strains against the squeeze, catching his breath.

                         them.  By that love we see                                 
                         potential in our beloved. Through

               Will has heard enough. He WHISTLES again, shrill and loud.           
               The black stag starts trudging forward.

               VEINS bulge in Hannibal's forehead, but he doesn't cry out or        
               protest.  His eyes never waver from Will's.

=== EXT. REST STOP – NIGHT ===

                                                                                    
               Snow flies. A lone SEMI TRAILER TRUCK idles in the parking           
               area, its trailer lights glowing yellow. Exhaust billows.            
                                                                                    
               More light spills from the rest stop bathroom as the TRUCKER         
               exits.  He heads into the night's cold and back to his rig.          
                                                                                    
               CAMERA comes across the truck's snow-covered windshield and          
               hood to find the trucker coming the length of his trailer.           
                                                                                    
               Then -- CREEEAK -- the trailer's bulk SHUDDERS and ROCKS on          
               its shocks before it's silent again. The tucker's puzzled.           
               CAMERA TILTS DOWN with the man as he squats to look under the        
               trailer.  There's nothing there. No tires blown.                     
                                                                                    
               The trucker turns suddenly to CAMERA, but there is nothing           
               there.  Turns back, still nothing.                                   
                                                                                    
               But he's spooked. Somewhere down in the dark parts of his            
               brain, he knows something is there.                                  
                                                                                    
               He moves back to his cab. Looks at the door. Pauses.  Is             
               something inside?                                                    
               He grabs the handle and pulls it open. NOTHING. He peers             
               in.  Relaxes.                                                        
                                                                                    
               He grabs the handrail and puts his boot on the step. Pulls           
               himself up.                                                          
                                                                                    
               Door open, the trucker steps up to enter, but pauses again as        
               SNOW drops onto his head. A NOISE above.                             
                                                                                    
               He looks up.                                                         
                                                                                    
               A HUNCHED, POWERFUL SILHOUETTE is on the roof of the cab.            
               Before he can open his mouth --                                      
               SPLAYED PAWS                                                         
                                                                                    
               Thrust down out of the snow and darkness.

               Sinking into his shoulders. The back of his neck.

               Yet the creature continues ravaging its victim. OFF the O.S.
