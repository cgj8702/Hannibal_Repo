HANNIBAL
"Dolce"

TEASER

EXT. FLORENCE - PREDAWN

A silhouetted Florence skyline as the sun threatens to rise.
DISSOLVE TO:

WATER

A CLOUD OF BLOOD blooms beneath the surface.
DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. FLORENTINE BRIDGE - DAWN

A silhouetted HANNIBAL LECTER limps home after his defeat at
the hands of Jack Crawford. Face bruised and bloody.
Walking through a deserted Florence. Clothes torn and
marked. He limps where Jack stuck the hook through his calf.
DISSOLVE TO:

CLOSE ON HANNIBAL'S BACK

Water runs over his head and neck, forming rivulets down his
back, over open wounds, which turn the tiny streams pink.

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. ARCHWAY - DAWN

Sunlight begins to burn at one end as a silhouetted Hannibal
staggers into the cool shadows of the alley.

This figure limps toward us, ghosting toward CAMERA, a series
of AFTERIMAGES lingering behind him as he limps closer.

DISSOLVE TO:
CLOSE ON HANNIBAL'S FACE

Hair wet, as water sluices down his face. Female hands wring
a sponge and water pours over him.

We are --

INT. HANNIBAL'S FLORENCE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

Hannibal lies in the bathtub. BEDELIA wrings a sponge and
water pours down Hannibal's beaten, cut and bruised body.

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 2.

CLOSE ON THE SPONGE

The water that drips is tainted with blood.

It sweeps down Hannibal's arms and chest. Across his burned
palms. Sensual and soothing.

Just OUT OF FOCUS, we see Bedelia kneeling by the tub,
tending him.
CLOSE -- Hannibal's calf is raised over the side of the
bathtub. The sponge sweeps across the ugly wound in the
flesh, ragged and raw.

Blood drips into the bathwater.

DISSOLVE TO:
A SHINING NEEDLE

Bedelia carefully and skillfully sutures the wound in
Hannibal's calf.

ON HANNIBAL watching her work -- as close as lovers. And
just as intimate, these two.

HANNIBAL'S POV -- ON BEDELIA

Her concentration. Drinking her in.
Bedelia finishes the last suture. Looks at Hannibal, finally.
She draws up the string and, as she CUTS it...

MATCH CUT TO:

CLOSE ON THE POWER CORD NOOSE
As it is CUT.

LOW ANGLE UP -- PAZZI'S DEAD BODY

FRAMED THROUGH THE OUTSTRETCHED ARMS of those on the ground,
reaching up to support the body as it is lowered.

THE SILHOUETTE OF DANGLING VISCERA
It is wrapped with netting around the whole mass, collecting
Pazzi's innards and keeping them not far from his body.

EXT. PALAZZO CAPPONI - DAY

Pazzi's body is collected by Florence POLIZIA, to the
resounding, medieval delight of the masses, as JACK CRAWFORD
grimly watches. Refusing to turn away, a penance of sorts.

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 3.

WILL GRAHAM (O.S.)
Jack.

Jack turns, scarcely daring to believe he heard right.

WILL GRAHAM

Stands just beyond the police barriers. Tired, showing the
bruises of his fall from the train.

Jack has to fight a sudden urge, to run and hug Will, that
surprised him. Huge relief.
He smiles at Will and Will returns it. Both men surprised
how strongly they feel. And then guilt hits them both and
they look to Pazzi.

Jack nods to an Italian cop and motions Will under the
barrier tape.

INT. PALAZZO CAPPONI - ATROCIOUS TORTURE EXHIBIT - DAY

Jack and Will move through the shattered interior of the
Atrocious Torture Exhibit where Jack and Hannibal did battle.
JACK CRAWFORD
He's wounded and worried.

WILL GRAHAM
Hannibal doesn't worry. Knowing
he's in danger won't rattle him any
more than killing does.

Jack examines the vintage WOODCARVING of Pazzi's ancestor
hanging, disemboweled.
JACK CRAWFORD
If Rinaldo Pazzi decided to do his
duty as an officer of the law, he
could have detained Dr. Fell and
determined very quickly that he was
Hannibal Lecter. Would have taken
thirty minutes to get a warrant.

WILL GRAHAM
All those resources were denied to
Pazzi. Once he decided to sell
Hannibal, he became a bounty hunter.
JACK CRAWFORD
Outside the law and alone. Here we
are: outside the law and alone.

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 4.

WILL GRAHAM
Again.

JACK CRAWFORD
We know how that usually turns out.
(then)
Mason Verger is trying to capture
Hannibal himself for purposes of
personal revenge.
WILL GRAHAM
Have you told la polizia they're
looking for Hannibal Lecter?

JACK CRAWFORD
They're motivated to find Dr. Fell
inside the law. Knowing who he
is... and what he's worth, will
just coax them out of bounds.
WILL GRAHAM
It would be a free-for-all.

JACK CRAWFORD
And Hannibal would slip away.
Would you slip away with him?
WILL GRAHAM
Part of me will always want to.

JACK CRAWFORD
You have to cut that part out.

Will looks around the displays of torture instruments.
WILL GRAHAM
Of course you would find him here.
Not because of the exhibit, but
because of the crowd it attracts.

Jack watches Will as he moves behind a STARVATION CAGE,
appearing as though he's trapped inside.

WILL GRAHAM (CONT’D)
You had him, Jack. He was beaten.
Why didn't you kill him?
Jack considers that a moment, then:

JACK CRAWFORD
Maybe I need you to.

OFF Jack...

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 5.

CLOSE ON A PENCIL

It drags across paper, leaving graphite debris in its wake.
A man's prominent shoulders have taken shape beneath the
pencil's tip as it continues to move. Instead of completing
the head on its shoulders, a stump is drawn.

HANNIBAL (V.O.)
Beheaded for refusing to worship
the Roman gods...

CAMERA scans the drawing and finds the severed head.
The pencil darkens the shadows under the lolling eyes.

HANNIBAL (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...the Christian martyr San Miniato
picked up his severed head from the
sand of the Roman amphitheater...

CAMERA reveals the drawing in its entirety.

The Christian martyr carries his severed head under his arm
as he lumbers down the Florentine street.
HANNIBAL (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...and carried it beneath his arm to
the mountainside across the river.

THE DRAWING BLEEDS COLOR

As it TRANSFORMS INTO REALITY and the figure carrying its
severed head fades. We are --

EXT. HANNIBAL'S FLORENCE APARTMENT - BALCONY - DAY

Hannibal, drawing on a pad, with some discomfort considering
his wounds, is gazing out over Florence and the modern street
that he's been sketching. Bedelia approaches.
HANNIBAL
His body passed along the ancient
streets below us. I want to be able
to draw these streets from memory.
(then)
I want to be able to draw the
Palazzo Vecchio and the Duomo.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
You won't be coming back here for a
very long time.

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 6.

HANNIBAL
Memories of Florence will be all I
have. Florence is where I became a
man. I see my end in my beginning.

She takes his pencil and pad, then turns to move inside.
Hannibal follows...

INT. HANNIBAL'S FLORENCE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

CONTINUOUS as Hannibal follows Bedelia inside.
BEDELIA DU MAURIER
All of our endings can be found in
our beginnings. History repeats
itself and we can't escape it.

Hannibal notices a small suitcase. His coat draped over it.

HANNIBAL
You packed lightly.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
I packed for you.
(off his look)
This is where I leave you. Or more
accurately, where you leave me.
HANNIBAL
This isn't how I intended to say good-
bye. I imagined it differently.

She stands confidently next to his packed suitcase.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
I didn't.

HANNIBAL
Didn't you?
BEDELIA DU MAURIER
I knew you were intending to eat me
and I knew you had no intention of
doing it hastily.

HANNIBAL
Would be a shame not to savor you.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
I haven't quite marinated long
enough for your tastes.
(then)
When they come for you...

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 7.

HANNIBAL
And they will come...

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
What will you say of me?

HANNIBAL
I will help you tell the version of
events you want to be told. I will
help you because you asked me to.

They exchange a smile, such strange bedfellows.
BEDELIA DU MAURIER
You may make a meal of me yet,
Hannibal...

Bedelia kisses Hannibal once on the lips. Both of them happy
to let it linger.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER (CONT’D)
...but not today.
CUT TO BLACK.

END OF TEASER

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 8.

ACT ONE

A ROW OF PIG ASSES

Their tails lined up as if in a Busby Berkeley freeze frame.

A CLEAVER

Slams THROUGH FRAME with a THUNK, removing a pig tail. THUNK-
THUNK-THUNK. Three more pig tails.
A ROW OF PIG TAILS

A chopping blade CHOP-CHOPS the tails into one-inch sections.

A COOKBOOK

FOCUS crawls over the pages of a cookery book. The cook's
finger follows a line...

A KNOT OF GINGER

It is peeled, cut and minced.
BLACK VINEGAR

It pools and spreads across a shallow dish.

CLOSE ON THE COOK'S FINGER

It follows another line...

CHOPPED PIG TAILS

Glazed, spiced and cooked.
We are --

INT. VERGER ESTATE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

MASON, in his wheelchair, is sitting like an eager schoolboy
at the industrial-grade kitchen's center island, which has
been laid out with fine linens, crystal, china and silver for
just the single place setting. Next to him, a bronze bowl.

CORDELL unfurls a beautifully-fanned napkin and tucks it
beneath Mason's chin.
He then places a plate, with a beautifully-prepared dish of
pig tails, before Mason.

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 9.

CORDELL
Pig tails. Cut into sections to
give the aesthetic of fingers cut
at the joint.

MASON VERGER
Finger food.
CORDELL
Hands are how we touch the world.
They're tactile. Sensual. Remove
an arm and your patient will still
feel phantom digits.
(offering a pig tail)
Imagine what Dr. Lecter will feel
watching you nibble on his fingers.

Mason almost gasps, impressed.

MASON VERGER
Poetry, Cordell. Poetry.
CORDELL
In a ginger-black vinegar sauce.

Mason takes a pig tail, chewing it and not really liking it.

MASON VERGER
Mmmm.
(sucks teeth)
It's mostly skin and bone.
CORDELL
The actual fingers will have more
meat, and then there's the marrow.

Cordell produces another dish.

CORDELL (CONT’D)
Here it is in a fermented bean sauce.

Mason takes the bean sauce pig tail and gives it a small chew.
MASON VERGER
I prefer the ginger.

Mason reaches for the gristle in his teeth.

CORDELL
No, no.
(re: the bronze bowl)
Spit.
Mason does as instructed and there is a small GONG sound.

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 10.

CORDELL (CONT’D)
A Buddhist singing bowl. The gong
represents the start of a new day.

MASON VERGER
Buddhists don't eat meat.

CORDELL
This isn't meat. This is man.

MASON VERGER
Papa always said meat is a people
business. He was a pioneer in
livestock production, I'm sure he's
eaten someone. Yet I must admit a
tremble at the notion myself.
CORDELL
I find there's something reassuring
about you eating Dr. Lecter. It
makes you the apex predator.

MASON VERGER
I like that. "Apex predator."
CORDELL
(a new idea)
We could Peking duck him. You have
to torture a duck to prepare it.
Pump its skin up with air, then
glaze it with a hot honey and hang
it by its neck until it dries.

MASON VERGER
Then roast until crispy.

As that idea idles with Mason...
DISSOLVE TO:

HANNIBAL

He stares directly into CAMERA, a THIN GLAZE coats his skin,
which BROWNS, ROASTS and CRACKLES.

POP WIDE
As CAMERA reveals Hannibal lying on his back, ROASTED WHOLE
and tastefully garnished to obscure parts that would offend.

We are --

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 11.

INT. VERGER ESTATE HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (DREAM STATE)

CAMERA crawls over Roasted Hannibal to find Mason Verger
sitting at the head of the table.

MASON VERGER
Transubstantiation.
A muffled phone BUZZING and we --

CUT TO:

CLOSE ON MASON VERGER'S EYES

They slowly open, still holding onto the dream. We are --

INT. VERGER ESTATE HOUSE - MASON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Without turning his head, Mason's hand walks on its fingers,
like a crab, to push a telephone button, the speaker under
his pillow, a microphone near the ruin of his face.

MASON VERGER
I'm here. Tell me.

MARGOT VERGER (V.O.)
It's a bloody casino.
MASON VERGER
Tell me.

A HUGE PLASMA-SCREEN TV

A broadcast of an ITALIAN NEWS STATION. An attractive FEMALE
ANCHOR reports in Italian. In the BURN-IN BOX next to her
head, eyewitness iPhone footage of the aftermath of Pazzi's
death in Florence. The body dangling above the piazza.
CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV to reveal we are --

INT. VERGER ESTATE HOUSE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

Mason, Cordell, MARGOT and ALANA are all watching the screen.
Alana mutes the television with a remote and she, Margot and
Cordell all turn and look at an inscrutable Mason. Finally:
CORDELL
How do you feel?

MASON VERGER
I feel like I just paid a lot of
money for a dead dago.

MARGOT VERGER
The feces will fly about Pazzi.

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 12.

MASON VERGER
Better to get it out that Pazzi was
dirty. They'll take it better if
he's dirty. Was he dirty?
MARGOT VERGER
Except for this, I don't know.

ALANA BLOOM
What if they trace Pazzi back to you?

MASON VERGER
I can take care of that.
ALANA BLOOM
You took care of Pazzi.

MASON VERGER
I have little interest in the
expensive piece of meat twitching
at the end of that electrical cord.

ALANA BLOOM
Hannibal can disappear too well and
you'll be left with nothing.

MARGOT VERGER
Better buy another cop.
ALANA BLOOM
Better buy the whole department.

A DARKENED CONDUIT

In the distance, light from the adjacent room throws warm
light through the grid of a vent, creating a shadowed pattern.

As CAMERA PUSHES IN, we hear the SQUEAK of screws unscrewing,
then the vent is removed. An arm reaches in, feeling around
the immediate vicinity until finding a SMALL LEATHER BAG,
taped to the roof of the vent, and pulling it free.
We are --

INT. HANNIBAL'S FLORENCE APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY

Bedelia removes the small leather bag from the vent.

CLOSE ON A TABLE

The small leather bag is unrolled, revealing an AMPOULE and a
HYPODERMIC NEEDLE.

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 13.

We are --

INT. HANNIBAL'S FLORENCE APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

Bedelia, seated in front of the unrolled leather bag and its
contents, wraps surgical tubing around her forearm, pulling
it taught to create a bulging vein.

With one end of the surgical tubing in her teeth, she picks
up her needle and ampoule, but when she looks up, she starts.

CHIYOH

Stands in the apartment, regarding Bedelia with curiosity,
her rifle resting on her hip.
ON BEDELIA

Without pulling the plunger to draw fluid from the ampoule,
she carefully removes the needle and sets it down.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
You must be looking for Hannibal
Lecter. One of his patients?

CHIYOH
No, not a patient. Where is he?
BEDELIA DU MAURIER
Gone.
(then)
Seeing how you let yourself in, I
hope it's not too forward to ask,
who the hell are you?

CHIYOH
Family.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
Ah.
(then)
You've come all the way from home.
CHIYOH
Who are you?

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
I'm his psychiatrist.

Chiyoh glances at the ampoule and needle.
BEDELIA DU MAURIER (CONT’D)
(off Chiyoh's look)
Medicinal purposes.

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 14.

Chiyoh studies Bedelia, eyes narrowing.
CHIYOH
You're like his bird.
(off her look)
I'm his bird, too. He puts us in
cages to see what we'll do.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
Fly away or dash ourselves dead
against the bars.
CHIYOH
You haven't flown away.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
You're flying right toward him.
How does he inspire such devotion?

CHIYOH
You're his psychiatrist.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
You could add to what I've learned
in my experience with him, and from
the mute postures of the dead.
(then)
Were you there? Did you watch as
the beast within him turned from
the teat and entered the world?
CHIYOH
I met the beast and I saw him grow.
Someone wants to kill him.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
More than one someone, I'd say.
(then)
What do you want?
CHIYOH
I want to cage him.

That makes Bedelia smile.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
I thought Will Graham was
Hannibal's biggest mistake. But I
have to wonder if it isn't you.
(then)
Now, if you'll excuse me, it's time
for me to take my medicine.
CUT TO:

HANNIBAL Ep. #306 "Dolce" FINAL DRAFT 12/13/14 15.

A SERIES OF STYLIZED SHOTS:

The world is rendered abstract.

MACRO VIEW -- the needle drawing fluid.

MACRO VIEW -- the needle stabbing into Bedelia's flesh.

MACRO VIEW -- the plunger forcing the fluid to rush like a
river.

MACRO VIEW -- Bedelia's pupil dilating wide.
ON BEDELIA

CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK revealing the walls around her
VIBRATING ever so slightly to the rhythm of her breath and
hum of her circulatory system. Throughout the vibration,
only Bedelia's image is STILL and CLEAR. All else writhes.

Bedelia closes her eyes, trying to focus through the vivid
distortions of reality. As CAMERA PUSHES IN, she closes her
eyes, taking in deep, controlled breaths.

KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK. Bedelia opens her eyes.

INT. HANNIBAL'S FLORENCE APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - DAY

The door opens revealing Bedelia. She stares blankly,
covering her dazed and slightly-unfocused eyes.

BEDELIA DU MAURIER
Yes?

REVERSE to reveal --

Jack and Will stand outside the door. Their images are
mostly still, only occasionally FL
