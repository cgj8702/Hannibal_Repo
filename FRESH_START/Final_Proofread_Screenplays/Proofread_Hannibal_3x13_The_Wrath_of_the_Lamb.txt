               This is Dolarhyde's Dragon shrine. The fragments of his

               Thinking quickly, Reba feels for the bed and pulls off the           
               blanket.  She moves to the flowers, grabbing vases, plucking         
               out the flowers and dumping the water onto the blanket,              
               soaking it. She pulls on the blanket, wrapping it round her          
               head, staying well below the smoke gathering near the ceiling.

               our focus on her, the damage more felt than seen.                    
               With her face covered, Reba moves for the door.

               find something. So aware of the fire around her. She is now --

               her hands and knees as they cross the rug, and then the

               Dolarhyde moves with her toward the door, tense. Through the         
               gas mask, we see the anxiety in Dolarhyde's eyes. He wants           
               Reba to make her escape.

               Nearly staggering with smoke inhalation, Reba moves through          
               the spreading fire and holds out the key -- and unlocks the          
               front door. Racked with coughs.                                      
                                                                                    
               Just as she gets to her feet in the doorway, though, Reba

               But Reba rights herself just before he reaches her, and he           
               backs off as she makes her way out on her own two feet.

               Reba lies in her hospital bed. Exhausted. Recovering from            
               smoke inhalation and burns. Will Graham sits beside her bed,         
               a female POLICE OFFICER in the room with them.

                         A man had tried to slap me once. I                         
                         was quiet and he couldn't find me --                       
                         he couldn't see either. This one                           
                         could see. He was crazy.  Crazy,                           
                         all right. That's it: crazy.                               
                                                                                    
               Reba's hand brings more ice to her lips.

                         Crazy is a fearsome word.

                         He shot himself in the face. I put                         
                         my hand in it. He set fire to the                          
                         house.  He shot himself. I put my                          
                         hand in it. He was on the floor...                         
                                                                                    
               She trails off, trying to contain her emotions.

                         I won't put you through this again,                        
                         but I'd like to come back by. Just                         
                         to say hi and see how you're doing.

                         How could you help it? A charmer                           
                         like me.                                                   
                                                                                    
               Bitterness and self-reproach evident in her voice. Will              
               won't let her go there.

                         You didn't draw a freak. You drew                          
                         a man with a freak on his back.

                         making them miss their mark. When

    === 11. INT. HOTEL - WILL GRAHAM'S ROOM - NIGHT ===

                                                                                    
               Will enters the dark hotel room, weary.                              
                                                                                    
               As he turns to close and lock the door, a SHADOW moves in the        
               darkness behind him.                                                 
                                                                                    
               He senses the movement just an instant too late. FOOTSTEPS           
               rush up behind him. As he turns --                                   
                                                                                    
               FRANCIS DOLARHYDE                                                    
               Seizes Will from behind and clamps a chloroformed washcloth          
               over his mouth.                                                      
                                                                                    
               Will kicks the door, propelling them both backward.                  
                                                                                    
               Dolarhyde staggers, but maintains his vise-like grip.                
                                                                                    
               Will thrashes violently in Dolarhyde's powerful arms.                
               Kicking over a bedside table. Kicking against any surface.           
               His struggles growing wilder, less coordinated.                      
                                                                                    
               Will's legs flying up into the air, perpendicular, but Dolarhyde     
               is so strong that he remains upright, absorbing Will's energy.       
               They smash into a mirror on the wall, crazing the glass, and,        
               for a moment, both men are reflected side by side in the             
               broken shards -- shattered and incomplete.                           
                                                                                    
               CLOSE ON WILL'S EYES                                                 
                                                                                    
               Will's eyes are wide -- panicked and furious.                        
                                                                                    
               Gradually growing unfocused.                                         
                                                                                    
               Until they glaze as the chloroform does its work.                    
               WILL'S LEGS                                                          
                                                                                    
               Kick feebly, then go limp.                                           
                                                                                    
               Will's eyes close, Dolarhyde's face right behind his. As             
               Will slides into unconsciousness, Dolarhyde relaxes his grip.        
                                                                                    
               Dolarhyde holds Will's limp body. Breathing heavily from the         
               struggle.  There is something subtly postcoital about it.

                         Uhhhh...                                                   
                                                                                    
               We are --                                                            
                                                                                    

    === 12. INT. HOTEL - WILL GRAHAM'S ROOM - NIGHT ===

               Will's slumped in his hotel chair, eyes peeling open. Blurry         
               shapes shuddering into focus...                                      
                                                                                    
               Dolarhyde stands over him, his silenced pistol in his hand.          
                                                                                    
                                   FRANCIS DOLARHYDE                                
                         Breathe deeply.                                            
                             (then)                                                 
                         Do you think you can sit up? Try                           
                         to sit up.                                                 
                                                                                    
               Will scoots up in the chair, propping himself up on elbows.          
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         You didn't break my back.                                  
                                                                                    
                                   FRANCIS DOLARHYDE                                
                         Not today.                                                 
                                                                                    
               Dolarhyde stares at Will a moment, studying him, then:               
                                                                                    
                                   FRANCIS DOLARHYDE (CONT’D)                       
                         Your face is closed to me.                                 
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         If I can see you, you can see me.                          
               Dolarhyde is amused by Will in a curious way.
