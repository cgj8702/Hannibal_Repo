                         I use the term Soundings because it
                         refers to a small group of pigs.

               CAMERA CONTINUES PULLING BACK OVER THE AUDIENCE to FIND THE

               As CAMERA FOLLOWS the outer ear’s natural curve moving into          
               DARKNESS, each individual sound of the PERFORMANCE is dialed         
               up and down as every instrument, every voice is singled out.         
                                                                                    
               DARKNESS... then Hannibal opens his eyes, they soften and            
               crinkle, enjoying the feast of sound around him.

               He casually focuses on Mrs. Komeda as she speaks:

                         It’s an entire performance. He                             
                         used to throw such exquisite dinner                        
                         parties. You heard me.  Used to.                           
               Hannibal teases her with false grandiosity and a warm smile:

                         strikes. I cannot force a feast.                           
                         A feast must present itself.

                         It’s a dinner party, not a unicorn.

                         But the feast is life. You put the                         
                         life in your belly and you live.                           
                                                                                    
               The Cultural Elite are charmed. Mr. Komeda notices Franklyn          
               and Tobias standing inside Hannibal’s peripheral vision.

                         to get your attention.                                     
                                                                                    
               Hannibal turns, smiles warmly without betraying their

                         This is my friend, Tobias.

                         Good evening.

                         my life outside the opera.

               Tackling the potential awkward moment with social aplomb,            
               Hannibal turns the subject back to the evening at hand:

                         I loved it. Every minute.

                         Don’t say too much. You must leave                         
                         something for us to discuss next

               Hannibal shakes Tobias’s hand, politely shooing him and              
               Franklyn away before turning back to the Cultural Elite:

               Will rubs the disrupted sleep out of his eyes, sitting next
               to JACK CRAWFORD in the backseat, who looks like he only just
               rubbed the sleep out of his own eyes. AGENTS up front.

                         The victim was found in his hotel
                         room bathtub. He had requested two
                         keys at check in.

                         No one saw a second guest come or
                         go.  Abdominal mutilation and organ
                         removal.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Sounds more like an urban legend
                         than the Chesapeake Ripper.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         The room is sealed off until you
                         get there. You’ll have it fresh.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Fresh?  Fresh as a daisy?

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Fresh enough to tell me if it’s the
                         Ripper.  Then you go back to class.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         You don’t want me in a classroom.
                         You want me to wrap my head so
                         tight around the Ripper, I won’t go
                         back to class until he’s caught.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         It’s your bad luck to be the best.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Expecting a few more bodies after
                         this one?

                         If it’s the Chesapeake Ripper I am.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Don’t let the Ripper stir you up.
                         Reason he left you Miriam Lass’ arm
                         is so he could poke you with it.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Why not the rest of her?

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         His other victims, he wanted to
                         humiliate in death, like a public
                         dissection. She was different.  He
                         respected Miriam Lass.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Probably impressed she found him.

                         He had to kill her. I would’ve, if
                         I were him. Just being practical.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         He could be starting another cycle.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         You’ve heard from the Ripper
                         directly. If he’s killing again,
                         he’s not going to be subtle about
                         it.  He’ll just pick up the phone.
                         (then)
                         Any more phone calls, Jack?

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         No.
                         (then)
                         If this is the Ripper, there will
                         be at least two more bodies, then
                         nothing for months, maybe years.
                         We’ll have a window to catch him
                         and then that window will close.
                         The last time it closed, I lost the
                         Ripper and I lost Miriam Lass.
               Jack lets that lay there a moment, then:

               ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN TO REVEAL:

               Will steps out of the elevator following immediately on
               Jack’s heels, averting his eyes from the scattered LOCAL
               POLICE OFFICERS lining the hallway adjacent to ROOM 727.

               Will waits outside ROOM 727 as CAMERA FOLLOWS JACK INTO:

               JACK ENTERS to FIND JIMMY PRICE dusting for fingerprints,
               BEVERLY KATZ combing the bed for hair and fibers, and BRIAN
               ZELLER tweezing something out of a TRAIL OF BLOOD that runs
               from the blood-stained bed to the bathroom in a wake of
               overturned furniture -- the path of a struggle. Small FLAGS
               indicate the larger PIECES OF TISSUE along the way.

                         It is fairly evident the man’s dead
                         just by looking at him.

                         I touched the body. A lot going on
                         with that body. Surgery was
                         performed. And then un-performed.
                         (then)
                         Hi, Will.

               Will waves quietly from the Hallway, which Brian ignores.

                         Surgery was un-performed with bare
                         hands.  Sutures were clawed open.
                         (off Jack’s look)
                         I did a little touching.

               THE BLACK STAG

               Will stops short and stares at it, approaching cautiously.

               Mr. Murray tumble into a dresser, knock over a chair. FWUM.

               The PENDULUM SWINGS once again REVEALING the BLACK STAG. It
               turns and walks into the bathroom. Will follows it.

               FWUM.  The PENDULUM SWINGS REVEALING Will as he tumbles into
               the bathtub with Mr. Murray on top of him. Will sees life
               fading from Mr. Murray’s eyes as he goes still.
               Acting quickly, Will pulls a scalpel from his bag of medical
               tools. He makes an incision along Mr. Murray’s chest, cracks
               the sternum, and spreads the ribs, taking his heart in hand.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         His heart seizes. I crack the
                         sternum... spread the ribs, take
                         his heart in my hand...

               Mr. Murray dies with Will wrist-deep in his chest.

               THROUGH THE BLACK ANTLERS

               Will stands over the BODY in the tub, breathing deeply. The
               BLACK STAG stands in the doorway behind him approaching.

               ON WILL

               He opens his eyes and he’s standing alone in the room over
               the dead man in the bathtub.

                         They let it die. But he doesn’t
                         die. He looks normal...

                         Wasn’t all together chance. I                              
                         kinda thought you’d be there, which                        
                         isn’t why I was there. I was there                         
                         because I like that sort of thing.                         
                         Just occurred to me you might, too.

                         Have you been drinking?

                         I had a glass of wine with my last                         
                         appointment.

                         She drank with a patient. I have                           
                         an unconventional psychiatrist.

                         We have that in common.

                         Am I your psychiatrist or are we                           
                         simply having conversations?

                         Yes, I think is the answer to that.

                         seeing a patient, I assure you, is                         
                         very conventional. Particularly                            
                         for evening appointments.

                         How long have you been seeing a                            
                         psychiatrist?

                         Since I chose to be a psychiatrist.                        
                         What’s good for the goose...

                         So these are just conversations.

                         The Chesapeake Ripper wants to
                         perform. Every brutal choice has
                         elegance, grace. His mutilations
                         hide the true nature of his crimes.

               It quickly slices into a BLOOD RED TOMATO, quickly and
               decoratively carves it into a semi-blooming ROSE.

               Hannibal places the ROSE/TOMATO in the sizzling pan with
               eleven others, a simmering fragrant blossom that loses its
               petals in one smooth whisk of the wooden spoon.

               There’s almost a sibling warmth to their dynamic, but
               something more softly vibrates just beneath the surface.

                         I’ve been unspeakably rude. I

                         I appreciate beer more than wine.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         It’s not what you appreciate. It’s
                         that you appreciate. A compromise.

                             (considers, then:)
                         I’m curious about something. Are
                         you purposefully avoiding the
                         subject of Will Graham?
                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Absolutely.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Not on my account, I hope. I’m
                         happy to get your perspective.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         It’s on Jack Crawford’s account. I
                         don’t want information about Will I
                         shouldn’t have as his friend. It’s
                         not even about Will. Jacob Hobbs
                         was a trial run. Jack’s obsessed
                         with the Chesapeake Ripper and he’s
                         grooming Will to catch him.
                                   HANNIBAL
                         And I sincerely hope he does. Did
                         Jack ask you to profile the Ripper?

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Not since I consulted on the case
                         with Miriam before she disappeared.

                         You had me examining Ph.D.
                         candidates that week.

                         I’m grateful you were examining
                         Ph.D. students and not the Ripper.

                         You realize those candidates
                         thought we were having an affair.
                             (then)
                         Why didn’t we?
                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         You were already having an affair.
                         Will does that, too, you know.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         What?  Have affairs?

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Flirtatiously change the subject.
                         You have that pathology in common.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Or we just have you in common. I
                         recall even before I met Will
                         Graham, you never spoke about him.
                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Probably because I just want
                         everybody to leave him alone.

               Empty.  After hours. The door opens and Jack enters. He
               takes in the silence as his eyes drift to the morgue drawers.
               There’s a BODY UNDER A SHEET in the BACKGROUND.

               As he focuses on the drawer from his dream. The same drawer
               that contained Miriam's arm. In his mind, the distance sound
               of her RINGING CELL PHONE filters up through the cracks in
               his subconscious, then just as quickly, fades away into the
               hum of the air conditioning.

               Jack turns back around, walks purposefully across the room,
               toward the specific drawer that contained Miram's arm.

               The drawer is empty.

               Jack turns to see...

               WILL IS GONE.

               The light levels are normal. It was the theater of Jack’s
               mind telling us his fears. As he closes the morgue drawer...

                         He’s not on the schedule.
               Will quietly mentions to Jack, Beverly as Hannibal:

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         If he’s not working with the
                         Ripper, he still needs a kidney.

               Beverly turns to Garage Manager, pelting him with questions.

                         Is there G.P.S. on that ambulance?

                                   GARAGE MANAGER
                         Mmm-hmm.

                         We can’t afford that kind of
                         hardware. We use consumer grade.

                                   GARAGE MANAGER
                         Yeah.

                                   BEVERLY KATZ
                         Jack, if the ambulance radio is on,
                         I can use a DF sweep to find it.

               Hannibal and Will exchange a glance, impressed.

                         This is very educational.

57 EXT. T.B.D. LOCATION - NIGHT 8

               The Missing Ambulance sits quietly in isolation. Although
               the cab is dark, a light burns brightly in the back windows.

               A CIRCLE OF FBI AGENTS silently tightens around the

               An FBI AGENT moves forward with a Crowbar TOOL, ready to
               force the Ambulance doors open on Jack’s signal.
               Jack gives the signal.

                         Do it.

               Hannibal sticks his hands into the PATIENT’s back,
               taking the wheel, as it were, working quickly.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD (CONT’D)

               Devon Silvestri raises his bloody, gloved hands, stepping
               away from his PATIENT, giving Hannibal room.

               The F.B.I. Agents swarm Devon Silvestri, searching him,
               cuffing him and hauling him violently to his feet.

               CAMERA FINDS Will Graham as he watches Hannibal perform
               impromptu surgery to save the PATIENT’s life.

=== 60 INT. F.B.I. ACADEMY - JACK CRAWFORD’S OFFICE - NIGHT 9  60 ===

                                                                                    
               CAMERA SLOWLY PUSHES IN ON Jack Crawford’s back as he studies        
               the CRIME WALL featuring the Chesapeake Ripper’s handiwork.          
               CAMERA CONTINUES TO PUSH IN, the wall dropping out of focus,         
               as Jack Crawford remains clearly in focus.

               ON MRS. KOMEDA                                                       
                                                                                    
               She applauds elegantly, yet enthusiastically.                        
                                                                                    
                                   MRS. KOMEDA

               Hannibal stands at the head of his table raising a glass of
