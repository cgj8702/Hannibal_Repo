               He lies on his cot, asleep, his head propped on a pillow             
               against the wall. Alexandre Dumas's Grand Dictionnaire de            
               Cuisine is open on his chest.                                        
                                                                                    
               Eyes still closed, he takes a long slow breath through his           
               nose, smelling the current of air that the CAMERA traveled.

               the thin line of glass between them makes it look as if they

                         destroyed it? Or did you simply                            
                         toss it into the nearest fire?

                         I'm here about Chicago and Buffalo.                        
                         You've read about it, I'm sure.

                         them.  They won't let me have

                         Thought you would have some ideas.

                         Came to get the old scent again.                           
                         Why don't you just smell yourself?

                         You accepted your father. Would it                         
                         be so difficult to accept me?

                         I don't know if it would be smart.

                         Abigail, but we do learn to avoid                          
                         or raise a certain amount of hell,                         
                         depending on which we prefer.

                         I'll need to collect some flesh.                           
                         Not a pound. Only a piece.                                 
                         Something you can live without.

               Hannibal takes her hands, gently, fatherly.

                         I couldn't bear to take your                               
                         fingers, not even one. They're so                          
                         lovely.  I was hoping to teach you                         
                         how to play the harpsichord.                               
               Hannibal notices the medical jar is nearly full of blood.

               A last drop of blood splashes into the jar and Hannibal              
               removes the needle and bandages the crook of Abigail's arm.

               Hannibal pulls her to her feet, placing the nozzle connected         
               to the medical jar filled with blood at neck height.

                         pressure. Blood leaves the body at                         
                         a gallop and then a stumble.

                         to the back of my skull. Felt like                         
                         a fly flitting around in there.
