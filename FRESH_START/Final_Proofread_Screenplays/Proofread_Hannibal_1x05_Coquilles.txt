                         I first noticed my keen sense of
                         smell when I was a young man. I
                         was aware one of my teachers had
                         stomach cancer even before he did.

               An almost imperceptible reaction from Bella Crawford.
               Exactly the effect Hannibal was trying to achieve. Then:

CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FIND the back of a LONE MAN standing at
               the Ice Machine, a sheen of sweat coating the nape of his
               neck (NOTE: We do not see his face).
    

               A FAMILY OF THREE (MAN, WOMAN, CHILD) shuffles by juggling
               their suitcases. The Lone Man scoops ice into his bucket to
               not draw attention to himself, glancing at the Family.
    

               LONE MAN’S P.O.V.
    

               The CHILD smiles and the Lone Man looks away. The Woman
               draws the child closer, protective but not too obvious.

               The Lone Man returns his attention to the PLINK-PLINK-PLINK
               of the Ice Machine. He slowly turns to see A COUPLE who we
               will call MR. and MRS. ANDERSON emerging from their room and
               walking toward the Ice Machine with a bucket.
               As they approach, the LONE MAN quickly starts scooping up ice
               into his bucket. He’s apparently afraid to look at Mr. and
               Mrs. Anderson, but can’t help himself.
    

               LONE MAN’S P.O.V.
    

               The flesh of Mr. and Mrs. Anderson’s face and hands are
               monstrously distorted, rippling trails of HEAT emanate from
               their bodies as his skin ROILS WITH FLAME.
               Demonic... hallucinogenic...

               The reflective fire of the approaching COUPLE flickers off
               the ice. OFF the ice beginning to melt...

                         I don’t know what good it will do.                         
                         It would just be complaining. I                            
                         don’t complain. Makes it easier to

                         I’ll complain to you. Jack sees                            
                         the world at its worst. Don’t need                         
                         him seeing me at mine. He already

                         I resent that Jack has too much to                         
                         worry about to worry about me.

                         couples counseling.

                         I’d recommend another psychiatrist                         
                         for couples. I wouldn’t want you                           
                         to have the home couch advantage.

                         It’s hard enough dealing with how I                        
                         feel about all this. Don’t need to                         
                         deal with how Jack feels about it.

                         There’s no one and only spiritual
                         center of the brain. Any idea of
                         God comes from many areas of the
                         mind working together in unison.
               Hannibal climbs down the ladder then tosses the book to Will.

                             (perusing the book)
                         Maybe I’m wrong. How do you profile
                         someone who has an anomaly in their
                         head changing the way they think?

                         A tumor can definitely affect brain
                         function, even causing vivid
                         hallucinations. However, what
                         appears to be driving your Angel
                         Maker to create heaven on Earth is
                         a simple issue of mortality.

                         You said he was afraid.

                         Not in any discernible way.
                         Perhaps in the way Gods abandon

               Jack Crawford lies in the dark, staring at the ceiling. Bella
               ENTERS and silently slips under the covers. A moment, then:

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Do you wait until I shut off my
                         light before you come to bed?

                         Not intentionally. I’m working
                         late, nothing personal.

                         Can we have a conversation or
                         should we go on pretending
                         everything is alright.

                         Okay, then it’s work. I need to
                         sort through some things. It’s
                         outside your jurisdiction, Jack.

                         I’m good at sorting through things.
                         Very least, I can underwhelm you
                         when you’re feeling overwhelmed.
                                   BELLA CRAWFORD
                         You’ve never been able to
                         underwhelm me.

                         There’s some confidential something
                         you can’t share with me, that it?

                         Is there anything I can offer you
                         romantically, physically,
                         spiritually that can help you?

                         So what I can do for you as your
                         husband is to leave you alone and
                         not ask you questions.

                         I won’t insult you by asking if
                         there’s someone else.

                         sort it out and we’ll go back to
                         being us or is this us now?

                         I love you, Bella.

               pollution hanging above the city. Scattered all around the

               He glances at the various homeless, paying them very little
               attention. He looks upward, toward the sky, toward heaven,
               taking a deep breath of the night air and exhaling.
               There is a distant clopping sound of boots on pavement. A
               security guard is moving through the winding path that cuts
               through the tents.
    

               As the security guard approaches, the lone man tenses at what
               horror he sees.
    

               The flesh of the security guard’s face and hands is
               monstrously distorted, rippling trails of heat emanate from
               his body as his skin roils with flame.
               Demonic... hallucinogenic...
    

               The lone man’s head turns to follow the Security Guard (not
               demonic, not distorted, not flaming) as he approaches.

               He glances at the various homeless, paying them very little
               attention. He looks upward, toward the sky, toward heaven,
               taking a deep breath of the night air and exhaling.
               There is a distant clopping sound of boots on pavement. A
               security guard is moving through the winding path that cuts
               through the tents.

               As the security guard approaches, the lone man tenses at what
               horror he sees.

               LONE MAN’S P.O.V.

               The flesh of the security guard’s face and hands is
               monstrously distorted, rippling trails of heat emanate from
               his body as his skin roils with flame.
               Demonic... hallucinogenic...

               OMNISCIENT P.O.V.

               The lone man’s head turns to follow the Security Guard (not
               demonic, not distorted, not flaming) as he approaches.

                                   LONE MAN
                         I see what you are.

               as a corona of sorts emanating down from the angel wings.

                         Why angels?

                         It isn’t Biblical. His angels have
                         wings.  In sculpture and paintings,
                         angels fly, but not in the Bible.

                         It’s really a very dull story,
                         isn’t it? The ending is always the
                         same and that same is that it ends.

                         The cancer is already withdrawing
                         me from our relationship. And
                         everything else. Maybe it’ll be
                         easier for Jack this way.

                         You said you could smell the
                         cancer.  What did it smell like?

               Bella Crawford takes a deep breath, sitting opposite
               Hannibal.  He allows her to gather her thoughts, then:
                                   HANNIBAL
                         Has Jack begun to suspect? He is a
                         behavioral specialist. He must know
                         you’re keeping something from him.

                                   BELLA CRAWFORD
                         Oh, he knows. He asked me if I was
                         having an affair by reassuring me
                         he didn’t have to ask.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         I doubt he believes you’re
                         unfaithful.
                                   BELLA CRAWFORD
                         Why do you doubt that?

                                   HANNIBAL
                         It’s clear you love your husband.

               That hits Bella harder than Hannibal thought. She deflects:

                                   BELLA CRAWFORD
                         Women who love their husbands still
                         find reasons to cheat on them.
                                   HANNIBAL
                         Not you. Yet you seem more betrayed
                         by Jack than your own body.

                                   BELLA CRAWFORD
                         I don’t feel betrayed by Jack. And
                         there’s no point being mad at
                         cancer for being cancer.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Sure there is.
                                   BELLA CRAWFORD
                         Cancer isn’t cruel. A tiny cell
                         wanders off from my liver and gets
                         lost.  It finds its way into my
                         lungs where it’s just trying to do
                         its job and grow a liver.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         What it’s growing and where it’s
                         growing it will likely kill you.

                         Not likely. It will kill me.  And
                         no amount of blueberries and
                         antioxidants can change that now.

                         But you hold Jack accountable for
                         his inability to cure cancer.
                             (off her look)
                         Should I have said his inability to
                         save you? That be more accurate?

                         I am slowly shrinking while that

                                   HANNIBAL
                         You’ll feel fine up until the
                         precise moment you don’t.

                         strolled along the quays of Livorno,

               Will lies in bed, staring at the ceiling as the ALARM CLOCK
               blinks from 11:31 PM to 3:45 AM. Will doesn’t close his eyes.
               Finally, his eyelids slowly close under their own weight.

               CLOSE ON WILL’S CLOSED EYES

               A distant, muffled BARKING slowly rouses him to consciousness

               Will paces, avoiding the patient hot seat.

                         I dream more now than I used to.

                         Your dreams were the one place you                         
                         could be physically safe                                   
                         relinquishing control. Not anymore.                        
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         I thought about zipping myself into                        
                         a sleeping bag before I go to                              
                         sleep, but it sounds too much like                         
                         a poor man’s straight jacket.                              
                                                                                    
               The STATUE OF THE BLACK STAG near the Patient EXIT draws             
               Will’s attention. He walks toward it.

                         Have you determined how this Angel                         
                         Maker is choosing his victims?

                         He doesn’t see people how everyone                         
                         else sees them. He can tell if                             
                         you’re naughty or nice. Or he                              
                         thinks he can.

                         God has given this Angel Maker

                         God didn’t give him insight. Gave                          
                         him a tumor. He’s just a man whose                         
                         brain is playing tricks on him.

                         easy peace. The Angel Maker wants                          
                         that same peace. He hopes to feel                          
                         his way cautiously inside it and                           
                         find it is endless all around him.

                         He’s going to be disappointed.

                         You accept the impossibility of                            
                         such a feeling. Whereas the Angel                          
                         Maker is still chasing it.                                 
               Hannibal crosses to study him as he studies the stag.

                         If he got close to it, that’s where                        
                         he would look for it again.

                         I’ve been trying to reconstruct his

               Jack Crawford and Will Graham sit opposite EMMA BUDISH (30s),
               a slightly anxious woman unsure why she is here.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Has he contacted you since he left?

                                   EMMA
                         I left him. And no, he hasn’t.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Why did you leave?

                                   EMMA
                         Because of his cancer. Makes me
                         sound like a horrible wife.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Sure you had your reasons.

                                   EMMA
                         I took a leave from work to be with
                         him.  I wanted to be there for him.
                         But what he wanted was to be alone.

               As she speaks, CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Jack, who is coming to the
               unfortunate realization he and Emma have something in common.

                                   EMMA (CONT’D)
                         He kept pulling away and pulling
                         away.  He made it clear he didn’t
                         want me there. Then it wasn’t
                         clear.  Then it didn’t matter why
                         he was acting the way he was.
               Will watches as Jack pours himself a glass of water and
               drinks, mind spinning. Will realizes he has to pick up the
               baton of the interrogation as Jack is clearly suddenly
               distracted.

                         It was weird for the kids. What
                         kind of mother exposes her children
                         to someone who’s losing their mind.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Was he ever violent, Mrs. Budish?

               Her hesitation suggests more than a yes or no answer.

                                   EMMA
                         He was angry. Never hit me or the
                         boys.  I thought when he got weak
                         enough, when the cancer got worse,
                         it wouldn’t be confusing for them.
                         They could just see him as a sick
                         man, and not someone so terrified.

                         Did your husband’s faith falter
                         after he was told about the cancer.

                         Eric wasn’t ever religious. Is he
                         doing something religious?

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         He may believe he is.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Your husband’s dying, Mrs. Budish.
                         Soon.  We want to find him before
                         he hurts himself or anyone else.
               The words coming out of Jack’s mouth have a larger import
               than they did only moments ago.

                                   EMMA
                         He died once before. Suffocated in
                         a fire when he was a little boy.
                         Fireman who resuscitated him said
                         he must’ve had a guardian angel.

                         I’m used to not getting information

                         You go back to your classroom and                          
                         there’s more killing that you could                        
                         have prevented, it will sour that

                         Maybe.  Then maybe I find a job as                         
                         a diesel mechanic in a boatyard.                           
                                                                                    
               Jack Crawford studies Will without saying anything, then             
               abruptly turns and walks out of the barn, leaving Will alone.

               Will stands there a moment, stung and reeling from the               
               confrontation, debating on how to proceed.

               As before. Will Graham turns to see that Elliot Budish is no
               longer hanging from the rafters, but is now within reach.

               ELLIOT BUDISH P.O.V.

               Will turns to see his attacker, the flesh of his face and
               hands is monstrously DISTORTED, RIPPLING trails of HEAT
               emanate from his body as his skin ROILS WITH FLAME.

               Demonic... hallucinogenic...

               OMNISCIENT P.O.V.
               Weak from the loss of blood from his self-inflicted wounds,
               delirious from his tumor, Elliot Budish looks upon Will (not
               demonic, not distorted, not flaming) and simply states:

                                   ELLIOT BUDISH
                         I see what you are.

               He stumbles forward, collapsing in apparent supplication on
               the floor. Will isn’t afraid, his hand calmly goes to his
               gun as he slowly steps out of reach.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         What do you see?
                                   ELLIOT BUDISH
                         Inside.  I can bring it out of you.

               Will raises his gun, training it on Budish but not firing,
               even as Budish advances. Will continues to back away.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Not all the way out.

               Jack Crawford is silhouetted in the doorway.

=== 28 INT. B.A.U. - JACK CRAWFORD’S OFFICE - DAY 6 ===

               Jack Crawford sits behind his desk, cupping his forehead in
               his hands as Will Graham ENTERS and quietly takes a seat.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         What do you want, Will?

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I’m going to sit here until you’re
                         ready to talk. You don’t have to
                         say a word until you’re ready, but
                         I’m not leaving until you do.

               A long, uncomfortable, anguish-filled moment, then:

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
