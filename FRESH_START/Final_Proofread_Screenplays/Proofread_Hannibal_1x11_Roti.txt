               The PT OFFICER doesn’t blink.

                         Regarding divorce, not that you’re

               Gideon shakes off that unfortunate thought, pressing on.

               Will sits where Gideon was sitting. The PENDULUM swings              
               across the BLOOD-STAINED walls and doors, lifting the blood.         
               FWUM. The PENDULUM swings and the pool of blood on the floor        
               has vanished. Will glances at the bench next to him to see a         
               small torn piece of flesh and a smear of blood. FWUM. Gone.          
               ON WILL GRAHAM                                                       
                                                                                    
               He glances up to see the PT OFFICER sitting opposite him and         
               the NURSE sitting on the adjacent bench.

                         All I need is to get one hand free.                        
                                                                                    
               They watch Will, who glances at the bench next to him where          
               the small torn piece of flesh and smear of blood once were.          
               Slamming his hand into the bench, Will dislocates his own            
               THUMB and quickly slides his hand free of the cuff.                  
               The PT OFFICER sees this and moves to stop him as Will               
               quickly pops his thumb back into place.                              
                                                                                    
               The PT Officer lands a blow to Will’s head, before Will pulls        
               him to the bench in a choke hold.

               roof of the van with his leg shackles, choking the man out.          
               The man falls to the floor dead allowing Will to flip the            
               Nurse onto the floor of the van. He takes a FREE HANDCUFF            
               and DRIVES deep INTO the Nurse’s neck. Will pulls on it and          
               the man’s throat is ripped out in a gush of blood that sprays

                         He wasn’t insane when he killed his                        
                         wife. Killing her drove him insane.                        
                         He disassociated from the previous                         
                         murders he committed. I didn’t                             
                         convince him he’s a serial killer.                         
                         I just reminded him of the fact.

                         while under your care, Doctor.

                         matter right now. If he thinks he                          
                         is or even if he’s confused on that

                         I hope he doesn’t for your sake.                           
                         Can’t imagine how you’d sleep with                         
                         that on your shoulders.

                         killed your nurse?

                         They thought he was unconscious.                           
                         The attendant left the nurse alone                         
                         for three minutes. And in those                            
                         three minutes Dr. Gideon did                               
                         horrible things. I am less

               He’s the only other man in the room. Camera pulls back as Jack speaks M.O.S., the twisting antlers pushing into frame like thorny branches, wrapping around Will’s point of view.

               Will is snapped from his schism by a sharp word from Jack.
               We are back to reality. The briefing has ended and the various FBI agents are moving into action.
                                                                                    
               Camera reveals Jack Crawford standing on the other side of the room, conferring with FBI agents. He glances at Will.
               Will resets to normal, his mind resuming sync with the room.
               He nods to Jack, who registers Will’s odd state with unease.

               Jack is with Will Graham. Zeller, Price and Katz are present
               with the bodies of the PT OFFICER and MALE NURSE on trays
               that have been slid out of open morgue drawers.

                                   BEVERLY KATZ
                         Gideon didn’t leave a manifesto.
                         We confiscated all correspondences
                         he got from outside admirers.
                         We’re going through everything now.

                                   JIMMY PRICE
                         Any secret communiques or coded
                         messages written in bodily fluids
                         or anything else, we’ll find them.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         You won’t find anything. Whatever
                         Gideon’s up to is all in his head.

               ANGLE TO INCLUDE A CLOSED MORGUE DRAWER

               Will notices a trickle of water streaming out of the seam.

               Brian Zeller sorts through ORGANS in STERILE bags, wrapped in
               narrow cords, until he finds two containers of gray matter.
                                   BRIAN ZELLER
                         Not much left in these heads. All
                         the organ removals were postmortem.
                         Including transorbital lobotomies.

               Jimmy removes the Dipstick from an evidence bag.

                                   JIMMY PRICE
                         Dipstick lobotomy.

               ON WILL

               He watches as the trickle of water from the morgue drawer
               forms a puddle that’s pooling around his feet.
                                   BEVERLY KATZ
                         It wasn’t technically a lobotomy.
                         Didn’t remove any of the brain,
                         just scrambled them.

                                                                                (CONTINUED)

                         Went in through the top of the eye
                         socket and whisked it around.
               Will realizes that no one else has noticed the pool of water.
               He glances back and it’s no longer there.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Why remove every other organ in
                         their bodies completely in tact and
                         then scramble their brains?

               Will tries to shake off his hallucination, adding:

                                   WILL GRAHAM

                         any kind of therapy. Poked and
                         prodded. Gave him tests.  Told him
                         who he was, who he wasn’t.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         I want a list of every doctor,
                         every therapist, anybody in any
                         kind of psychiatric field who ever
                         had a conversation with Gideon.

    FREDDIE'S POV
    

    Bound to a chair, PAUL CARRUTHERS is bleeding out. A CANNULA
    is lodged in the sides of his neck, having slowly drained his
    blood.  He’s flanked by TWO IV STANDS on each side, each one
    holding a liter of blood.
    His throat has been slashed and his tongue has been pulled
    through the open wound to create a "Columbian Neck Tie."
    

    As Carruthers's tongue twists and trembles, Dr. Gideon does
    his best to straighten it like a proper neck tie. Once the
    tongue is flattened, he turns to reveal he has a handgun
    which he points at Freddie.

            that the Chesapeake Ripper once

            as a bookmark in his Bible.

                         instance, I mostly want to see the                         
                         look on your face.                                         
                                   DR. CHILTON                                      
                         Please... you’re not the Chesapeake                        
                         Ripper, you don’t have to do this.

                         No, I’m not. And yes, I do.  You                           
                         got inside my head, Fredrick. Now                          
                         I’m getting inside you.                                    
                                                                                    
               Chilton’s head turns and he sees Freddie Lounds holding a            
               pump ventilator.                                                     
                                   DR. GIDEON (CONT’D)
                         You’ve met Freddie Lounds. She’ll                          
                         be assisting me today. More you.                           
                         I’ll have her manually pumping the                         
                         ventilator to keep you breathing.                          
                                                                                    
               A terrified Freddie glances at Chilton, then averts her eyes.

                         Before we begin, I have to ask:                            
                         while you were fumbling with my                            
                         mind, did you ever think the real                          
                         Chesapeake Ripper would kill again?                        
                                   DR. CHILTON                                      
                         He’d be dismissed as a copy cat.

                         I hope he considers what I’m about                         
                         to do to you an apology for any                            
                         part I played in that insult.

               Gideon makes a long incision along Dr. Chilton’s abdomen, who

                         In the event we never meet, I                              
                         thought I’d leave him a gift. Or                           
                         rather a gift basket.                                      
               Gideon works BELOW FRAME, slowly removing an organ that              
               steams ever-so-slightly in the cold room.

                         It’s amazing how many organs the                           
                         body can offer up before it really                         
                         starts to suffer.                                          
                                                                                    
               Dr. Chilton’s eyes begin to role into the back of his head.          
               Gideon gently slaps him repeatedly with the back of his hand,        
               bringing Dr. Chilton’s eyes back into focus.

               Crawford EXITS the observatory and confers with FBI AGENTS.

               They watch each other for a still moment.

               Will slowly un-holsters his gun. He raises his weapon at the
               Stag, his finger tensing on the trigger.

                         more about who you are beyond that.
               Gideon is struck silent by that assessment. Hannibal sits
               opposite Gideon at the dining table.

                         A terrible thing to have your
                         identity taken from you.
                                   DR. GIDEON
                         I’m taking it back one piece at a
                         time. You should see the pieces I
                         got out of my psychiatrist.

                         Alana Bloom was one of your
                         psychiatrists, too. Is that right?
                                   DR. GIDEON
                         Yes. Dr. Bloom.

                         I can tell you where to find her.

               Will shakes his head, confused. Garret Jacob Hobbs watches           
               him from across the dining room table.

                         killed him. You watched him die.

                         I was with Garret Jacob Hobbs.

                         I don’t know if I’ll feel like
                         myself again. I don’t know if
                         there’s a self left to feel like.
                         I spent so much time believing I
                         was him it got harder to remember
                         who I was when I wasn’t him.

                         You.

               Will is horrified by Garret Jacob Hobbs’ comparison.

                         We’re both here. Looking at her.
                         Just those kind of people who
                         shouldn’t be in a relationship.
                         You and I are already committed.
                         Hard to be with another person when
                         you can’t get out of your own head.

                         I want to get out.

                         We all want things we can’t have.
                             (then, re: Alana)
                         If I kill her... like he would kill
                         her... I wonder if I could
                         understand him better, hear the
                         cold drips in his darkness, watch
                         the world through his red haze.

               He turns to Will and we REVEAL GIDEON is GARRET JACOB HOBBS.

               Alana JUMPS at the SUDDEN sound of a GUNSHOT outside.

               Sweating, breathing heavily. The GUN drops from his hand and
               drops the GRASS next to Gideon.

               Jack stares at pictures of Abel Gideon on his corkboard
               before pulling them down, along with the maps of his escape.

                         At least Will remains in one piece.
                         For now. His temperature is 105.
                         White blood cell count is twice
                         normal.  They still can’t identify
                         the source of the infection.

                         You seem confident.

                         Even with a 105 degree fever, Will
                         brought Gideon down. He’s going to
                         be fine. I told you.  Will always
                         comes back to being Will.

                         Will’s sense of self has not been
                         constant or even continuous. How
                         he thinks of what he does is
                         becoming less and less evident.
                             (then)
                         I would recommend you suspend his
                         license to carry firearms.
               Jack glances at Hannibal -- that’s a serious recommendation.

                         Are you having a difference of
                         opinion about who Will is?

                         I know who Will is. Will knows who
                         he is.  But our experiences shape
