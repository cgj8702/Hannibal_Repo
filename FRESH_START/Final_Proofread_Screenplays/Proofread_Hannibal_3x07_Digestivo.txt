The meat truck has been backed through the doors into the            
               narrow end of a funnel made by two angled rows of STEEL              
               PIGPENS.  PIGS snort nervously in the pens, clanging the bars.       
                                                                                    
               Mason Verger, in his wheelchair, and Cordell watch as                
               Inspector Benetti leads bodyguards bringing Hannibal and Will        
               from the truck, bound securely to a pair of handcarts.               
               Will's head is cleaned up and bandaged. But he is still              
               groggy and in pain.

                         It is more trouble physically to                           
                         move a semi-wild pig against its

                         Pigs are harder to get hold of, and                        
                         big ones are stronger than a man.                          
                                                                                    
               As Hannibal and Will are wheeled past, Mason speaks up for

                         There are the tusks to consider, if                        
                         you want to maintain the integrity

               Will's and Hannibal's handcarts are shackled to the walls.           
               Mason wheels closer to Hannibal, cocking his head up.

               Cordell has just placed them into FRAME. Hannibal glances at

               bright new head bandage. Mason glances at Will:
