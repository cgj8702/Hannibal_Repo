               HANNIBAL LECTER comes along the platform, pauses as the              
               sunlight strikes his face. Looks up and smiles.

               Watching Hannibal from the platform, taking him in. Hannibal         
               senses her gaze and meets her eye. She walks to meet him.

                         I ran into Will Graham.                                    
                                                                                    
               Bedelia hesitates in her step. Hannibal keeps walking, and           
               we STAY ON Bedelia assimilating this information.

               The attic space, windows flooding it with shafts of light.           
               Hannibal is silent. Bedelia sips from a glass of red wine.

                         us look for a lost object: we                              
                         review its image in our minds and                          
                         compare that image to what we see.

                         It was nice. Among other things.                           
                             (then)                                                 
                         He knew where to look for me.

                         You knew where he would look.

                         He said he forgave me.                                     
               Bedelia stares, fascinated by the strange, complex                   
               relationship between these two men.

                         Forgiveness is too great and                               
                         difficult for one person. It                               
                         requires two: betrayer and                                 
                         betrayed. Which one are you?

                         I'm vague on those details.

                         seen as something more akin to                             
                         falling in love.

                         whom you fall in love.

                         Is that concern for your patient or                        
                         concern for yourself?

                         I'm not concerned about me. I know                         
                         exactly how I will be navigating my                        
                         way out of whatever it is I’ve                             
                         gotten myself into. Do you?

               Will Graham walks backward through the chapel, which is              
               DIMMING around him, until he is surrounded by DARKNESS.              
               CAMERA reveals the floor is no longer the marble of the

               He continues to walk backward across the blood floor, and            
               finally stops. He takes a breath and closes his eyes.

               starts walking forward as CAMERA reveals him on a dirt road,

               Will's car is off the side of a dirt road, near a high stone         
               wall.  He dons a backpack. Will inspects the sky -- gray,            
               thick clouds. In the distance, a roll of THUNDER.

               In the high stone wall. Held shut with a thick chain.                
               Padlock hanging on the inside. Will finds a handhold and             
               begins to scale the gate. He pulls himself up and over.              
                                                                                    
               As Will drops down and lands on the other side, great laden          
               drops of rain begin to fall, hard and fast.                          
               CAMERA FLOATS UP through the deluge, revealing a stone               
               archway.  On it is carved: "LECTER DVARAS."

               An imposing-but-crumbling castle, the woods around growing           
               wild as if to engulf it. The woods seem to lean in toward

               In a meadow clearing, amid the woods, a small cottage stands,        
               dwarfed by the castle's crumbling shadow. We watch as Will           
               Graham walks toward it.

               TEMPLE TO TEMPLE -- bisecting the frontal lobe, impairing his        
               speech and slowing motor skills. He stares, eyes unfocused.

                         That may have been impulsive.

                         Been mulling that impulse since you                        
                         decided to serve Punch Romaine.

               His affect is flat, almost conversational.

                         I'm spiraling. Life spirals.

               Sogliato's muttering continues, his hands fuss with his              
               cutlery.  A thin line of blood runs down one side of his face.       
                                                                                    
               Bedelia picks up her napkin. Wraps it around the handle of           
               the ice pick and pulls it out. Places it on the table.               
               Blood pours more freely from the wound on the side of Sogliato's     
               head, and he slowly slumps face first into the bowl of olives.

               As JACK CRAWFORD, a scar on his throat -- largely hidden by a        
               graying beard -- steps into the light and moves down the             
               aisle toward the altar.                                              
                                                                                    
               He reaches into his coat and pulls out a CRIME SCENE PHOTO of        
               the DIMMOND HEART.                                                   
                                                                                    
               He stares at the space in which the body was displayed, and          
               then looks up at the stained-glass windows; taking in the            
               austere majesty of the space. Jack takes a deep breath, as

                         I'm not here for the Monster. Not                          
                         my house. Not my fire.

=== ? EXT. LECTER ESTATE - FOREST - NIGHT ===

                                                                                    
               The woods drip with the earlier rain. A LOW FIRE flickers at         
               ground level, sending shadows through the crowding trees and         
               undergrowth.                                                         
                                                                                    
               Will Graham hunches over it, wrapped against the cold and            
               wet.  Something moves beyond the dull circle of light, in the        
               Stygian dark beyond, and Will strains to see what it is.             
                                                                                    
               He pulls a FLASHLIGHT from his backpack and flicks it on.            
               Darkness stares back.
