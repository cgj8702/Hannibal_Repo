                                          TEASER                                    
                                                                                    
               BLACK                                                                
                                                                                    
               A PANNING LIGHT reveals a HUMAN FACE frozen in torment. Then a HAND grasping for freedom. Our light now reveals the TORSO, lean and stretched in agony.
               WIDER -- our light casts across a vertical group of HUMAN BODIES, and as we move over it, the bodies ANIMATE, writhing in torment.
                                                                                    
               REVERSE WIDE -- to blackness, and our light is now a PINPOINT. Slowly enlarging as it comes toward us. And a LOW DRONE accompanies it, indistinct, but unsettling.
                                                                                    
               The circle of light grows, and MORPHS into an EYE, unblinking, as our drone increases, and then our eye again MORPHS, becoming the SPINNING FRONT WHEEL of a motorcycle.
               CLOSE ON A GLOVED HAND as it works the throttle, and the drone PITCHES HIGHER as the bike changes gear.
                                                                                    
               ON OUR TORTURED HUMAN FORMS as they writhe against one another -- and then, IMAGE IS SPLIT by the motorcycle's front wheel as it splashes through the PUDDLE in which they were reflected.
                                                                                    
               CLOSE ON WATER DROPLETS as they are launched into the air, like bubbles, a tortured soul reflecting, trapped, in each as they spin through the air and turn BLOOD RED.
                                                                                    
               CLOSE ON THE REFLECTIVE BLACK VISOR of our bike's RIDER -- Figures writhe within the margins of the glass.
                                                                                    
               REVERSE -- WIDE -- behind the motorbike, now DWARFED IN FRAME as it rides toward an IMMENSE PAIR OF GATES -- Rodin's Gates of Hell, the sculpted bodies, caught in torment, adorning each side.
                                                                                    
               REVERSE AGAIN -- and now we are back on our rider's visor -- the gates fill the visor, and as the rider gets closer, we watch in the reflection as the gates BEGIN TO OPEN --
                                                                                    
               And through the opening space we see PARIS OPENING UP BEYOND.
               The bike speeds through the gates, sending the tortured figures into a new frenzy, and then he is through and the reflection is now the frenzy of a PARIS NIGHT STREET...

=== ? EXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT ===

               The motorcycle -- a TRIUMPH BONNEVILLE -- swerves and cuts between two cars like a knife through butter.
                                                                                    
               The Bonneville dances between lanes as the rider throws his weight from side to side.
                                                                                    
               We enjoy his progress; his skill and prowess as he owns the road.
                                                                                    
               CLOSE ON the reflective visor of his helmet, the world beyond zooming by, reflected in the black glass.
               His gloved hands on the throttle; his foot as it kicks the powerful bike through the gears.
                                                                                    
               The Bonneville BRAKES to a sudden halt. The rider gets off.
                                                                                    
               Dressed in Belstaff. He removes the helmet. For a brief second, those bodies writhe across it again -- there, and then gone -- and we see the rider now: it is HANNIBAL LECTER.
                                                                                    
               As we haven't seen him before. Looser, longer hair; a little rougher; a man free of responsibilities.
                                                                                    

=== ? INT. PARIS PARTY VENUE - NIGHT ===

               PALE YELLOW LIQUID fizzes into a glass flute. A hand takes the champagne and moves from a bar, and we go with it, revealing -- A PARTY CROWD -- under a banner: "Bon Voyage, Roman Fell."
                                                                                    
               It is a well-heeled leaving party for DR. ROMAN FELL, a tall, lean man of 50, sporting a fine academic's beard. He holds court in the center of the room. He loves the attention of a crowd of young acolytes and well-wishers.
                                                                                    
               We move through the throng, toward him. As people part in front of us, we REVERSE to reveal this is Hannibal Lecter's POV. His eyes fixed on Roman Fell.
                                                                                    
               STAY ON Hannibal as he moves lithely through the crowd, bodies between him and us, he is there and then gone -- like a tiger moving through the long grass. His eyes never leaving his prey. Appraising, calculating...
                                                                                    
               A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN crosses his path, makes eye contact.
               Hannibal returns it. Raises his glass.
                                                                                    
               She smiles, but Hannibal inclines his head and passes on the invitation to linger. Steps around her.

               ANTONY DIMMOND, 40s, tall, lean, somewhat louche-looking -- his clothes expensive, but old and worn -- darts suddenly at a WAITRESS with a tray of champagne, snaffles two glasses.
                                   ANTONY DIMMOND
                             (re: his two glasses)
                         It's a double-fisted kind of bash.
                             (then)
                         Antony Dimmond. I'd offer a hand,
                         but--
                                                                                    
                                   HANNIBAL
                         It's a double-fisted kind of bash.
                                   ANTONY DIMMOND
                         Do you know Roman well?
                                                                                    
               Dimmond clocks Hannibal's eyes wandering back toward Dr. Fell amid a circle of people.
                                                                                    
                                   ANTONY DIMMOND (CONT’D)
                         You were staring with the thinly-
                         veiled disdain of a man who does.
                         I was his TA at Cambridge. He was
                         insufferable even then.
               Dimmond finishes the second flute of champagne and puts it on a passing tray. Grabs two more and hands Hannibal one of them.
                                                                                    
                                   ANTONY DIMMOND (CONT’D)
                         Have you read his books? They're
                         terrible. You know they're
                         terrible, but you're too polite to
                         say. Blink if you agree.
                             (off his blink)
                         See.
               Dimmond pulls a weathered paperback from his coat pocket.
                                                                                    
                                   ANTONY DIMMOND (CONT’D)
                         That doesn't stop him squatting
                         over a keyboard and depositing a
                         fresh one every six to eight
                         months. It has taken me six to
                         eight months to write one line.
                                                                                    
                                   HANNIBAL
                         Why?
                                                                                    
               Dimmond stares at Hannibal a moment, as if the answer is abundantly clear, then:

                         Poetry is hard. Was too hard for
                         Roman. Easier for him to slide into
                         academia and dissect the efforts of
                         others than stand by his own words.

                         One can appreciate another's words
                         without dissecting them. Though,
                         on occasion, dissection is the only
                         thing that will do.

               Dr. Roman Fell walks home, merrily drunk, excited by the prospect of his new adventure.
