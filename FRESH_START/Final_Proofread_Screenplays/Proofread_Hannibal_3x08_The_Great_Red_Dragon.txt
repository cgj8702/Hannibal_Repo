               SURFACE OF A DESERT PLANET                                           
                                                                                    
               A craggy, dry, arid landscape. Patterned ridges alternate            
               with troughs as deep as canyons. A sense of aridness and             
               desolation. It feels a thousand years old.                           
               CAMERA VERY SLOWLY PULLS OUT, moving upward, revealing this          
               is no landscape... as the ridges resolve into --                     
                                                                                    
               THE CREASED SKIN OF A MAN'S KNUCKLE.                                 
                                                                                    
               PULL EVEN FURTHER OUT, and the back of a hand comes into             
               view.  The hand rests on a Formica table, beside a magazine.         
                                                                                    
               It is a strong, well-formed hand. But not a young one.               
               Every wrinkle and crease is detailed in CRISP FOCUS. To look         
               on this hand is to be aware of its age, its imperfections.           
                                                                                    
               Now reveal the man staring down at it -- its owner:                  
                                                                                    
               FRANCIS DOLARHYDE.                                                   
                                                                                    
               Dolarhyde, early 40s, is a large man, strong, muscular. With         
               a hint of vulnerability and diffidence.                              
                                                                                    
               The look in his eyes as he gazes down at that hand -- as if          
               suddenly really seeing it for the first time -- might be             
               mournful, fearful or both.                                           
               His other hand is pressed under his nose, knuckles concealing        
               his mouth and chin. We are --

               Dolarhyde sits alone. His back to the rest of the break room         
               where several COWORKERS chat among themselves. Their                 
               laughter rising above the tinned Muzak version of "In-A-Gadda-       
               Da-Vida" playing over speakers.                                      
                                                                                    
               Dolarhyde is clearly apart from them.                                
               He takes his other hand from his mouth -- revealing the scar         
               of a CLEFT LIP. Something he is deeply conscious of. But             
               right now, he remains mesmerized by --

               THE BACK OF HIS HAND -- DOLARHYDE'S POV                              
               ULTRA-SHALLOW FOCUS (the magazine open on the table behind           
               his hand is completely out of focus) as Dolarhyde moves his          
               hand slowly, watching the skin crinkle. A quiet SUSURRATION          
               is audible, like brittle paper rustling, amplified.                  
                                                                                    
               Now RACK FOCUS to turn his hand soft and bring the magazine          
               below it into CRISP FOCUS. It is a Time magazine and it's            
               open to a page about a William Blake retrospective.                  
                                                                                    
               FOCUS ON a full-page picture of one of Blake's paintings,            
               beneath Dolarhyde's hand, as if he is creeping up on and             
               about to touch --                                                    
               THE GREAT RED DRAGON

               Inscrutability giving way to awe. OFF him, rapt...

               TENDONS and LIGAMENTS standing out.

               CLOSE-UP, erotically-fetishistic detail of his physique as he

               We are --                                                            
                                                                                    

=== ? INT. DOLARHYDE'S HOUSE - ATTIC - NIGHT ===

                                                                                    
               The attic room of a large Victorian house, cluttered with            
               antique furniture of all kinds, old books and ledgers.               
                                                                                    
               Dolarhyde holds himself in an excruciating yoga pose, nearly         
               nude.  His body is meticulously maintained; he's a beast.            
                                                                                    
               He holds the pose an extra beat. Uncomfortable to watch.             
               Forcing himself into superior condition.                             
               Finally, he releases the pose and stands slumped, shoulders          
               rising and falling. Then, through his weariness:

               A faint sound calls his attention. A GROWL. So soft he               
               barely heard it. From elsewhere in the house.                        
               He listens intently, very still.

               needle stabbing like an insect's stinger, as the unseen              
               tattooist begins his work. Black ink and blood appear on the         
               skin.  As the tattooist's finger wipes his work, we --

               Stands now before an old, BROKEN FULL-LENGTH MIRROR and              
               regards himself in the broken pieces. His face in fragments.         
                                                                                    
               He presses a hand gently to his throat as he practices his           
               glottal stops. The moment feels painfully intimate, private.

               Amid the fractured glass, his scar split by a crack... a man         
               in pieces. Then:                                                     
                                                                                    
               The GROWL comes again. Dolarhyde's eyes jump. This time it           
               is louder, closer. He looks around, confused.                        
                                                                                    
               The NOISE comes a second time, fainter, before trailing off.         
               He listens. Dread and awful curiosity in his eyes...

               Resting on the Formica table in the break room. An echo of           
               the opening shot of his hand.

               But now he's slowly opening and closing his hand, as if              
               feeling new sensations. Sensing untapped power.

               As he regards his own hand with fear and awe... Isolated             
               from the DIM MURMUR of work conversations in the background.

               The pieces of an old FILM CAMERA lie disassembled on the table.      
               Dolarhyde's hands carefully polish a lens with a silk cloth.         
                                                                                    
               We are back in his attic room. His breathing is slow and             
               shallow as he works, utterly focused. And then:                      
                                                                                    
               The NOISE comes again -- far louder than before.                     
                                                                                    
               Dolarhyde's hands freeze. He looks up with a sharp intake of

               The NOISE, harsh and guttural, comes a second time, LOUDER.          
               Insistent.  Primordial. It seems to be reverberating through         
               the house, coming from many places at once. Seemingly                
               filling his head and the house at the same time.                     
                                                                                    
               Dolarhyde waits, his eyes wide with fear and anticipation.           
                                                                                    
               Slowly, his gaze turns to something in the far corner. We go         
               into his POV to see:

               Snaggletoothed and yellowed. An old lady's dentures, resting         
               in a dry glass, the water long since evaporated.                     
               PUSH IN on those dentures... which VIBRATE ever so slightly,         
               RATTLING in the glass as the NOISE comes again, building now,        
               as if it is coming from the dentures themselves. And as it           
               approaches a ROAR...                                                 
                                                                                    
               Meld the NOISE with a different BUZZING ROAR and --

               The tattoo needle is PULSING in and out of skin. Reds and            
               blacks form into shading, a picture taking form...

               A Chinese DENTIST places a box on a glass counter. He opens          
               it and pulls out the contents. Places them on the glass with         
               a CLINK.  Looks toward CAMERA for approval.                          
                                                                                    
               CLOSE -- the light from the display cabinets shines through a        
               set of NEW DENTURES, perfect oversized replicas of                   
               Grandmother's teeth.                                                 
                                                                                    
               Reveal now that Dolarhyde is the client. Looking at the              
               dentures with awe, a trace of fear... As he reaches for              
               them, PRE-LAP the tattoo needle's ROAR.

               A Chinese man, intensely focused as he applies the tattoo.           
               This, too, is in Hong Kong.

               Filling the screen, its noise hurting our ears... the current

               Abrupt, jarring silence. The sound of the needle gone.               
               Sudden bright sunlight cutting through foliage.

               Picks at the tree, peeling bark and whittling a shape. As we         
               watch, it becomes the Chinese symbol for the RED DRAGON.

               Intent as he carves the symbol. He is high up in the tree.           
               He smiles -- and then a noise off-screen makes him turn.
