               WILL GRAHAM lies with dogs, enjoying three fingers of whiskey.         
               The SPACE HEATER in the fireplace emits a warm halo around           
               the pack as Will works over the innards of the boat motor.           
                                                                                    
               Will stops working, listening. He eyes the dogs, they don’t          
               react, going about their leisure. Will returns to work.              
               A distant, almost imperceptible CRY. Will stops again. He            
               glances at the dogs, they still don’t react. Another WIMPER.         
               Just as far away, but louder. Whatever it is, it’s desperate.        
                                                                                    
               Will stands, shrugs on a coat and grabs a flashlight.

               Will walks onto the front porch, closing the door so the dogs        
               can’t follow him. He listens.  An even more frantic CRY.             
               Will hurries off the porch in the direction of the distress.

               The crying is more intense now. It rises and falls, growing          
               louder and softer as Will searches, wincing at the horrible          
               sound of the high-pitched, fear-induced whines.

               Will holds his breath, listening, shining his flashlight in          
               the direction of the last, sad whimper. Nothing.

               An inscrutable Hannibal sits across from Franklyn.

                                   FRANKLYN
                         I have a lot of respect for you and
                         what you do. Since I can’t be your
                         friend, or you’re not comfortable
                         with that, I found myself looking
                         at my friends through your eyes.
                         Imagining what you’d say about
                         them. What your diagnosis would be.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         So you become the psychoanalyst?

                                   FRANKLYN
                         Little bit. Or I become you.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         That’s an insightful observation.

                                   FRANKLYN
                         You helped me get to know myself.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Who are you psychoanalyzing?

                                   FRANKLYN
                         My friend Tobias.

                         the checklist and was a little
                         surprised how many boxes I checked.

                         forensics, that’s what it is.

                         But it’s not getting easier, Jack.                         
                         I shake it off and keep looking.

                         Good.  You shake it off.

                         You’re all wired. I’ll come back                           
                         in when you tell me.                                       
                                                                                    
               Jack turns, climbing down from the stage. A POLICE OFFICER           
               pulls the AUDITORIUM DOORS CLOSED behind Jack. The other SET         
               OF DOORS are CLOSED by another LOCAL POLICE OFFICER.                 
               Will Graham is now alone. He crosses the stage, circles the          
               Dead Man.  He takes a breath, exhales, then closes his eyes.

               It swings in the darkness of Will Graham’s mind, keeping             
               rhythm with his heart beat. FWUM.  FWUM.

               He walks backward, away from the Dead Man, toward the lip of         
               the stage. He climbs down and sits in the front row.

               the character of the killer.

                         I wanted to play him. I wanted to                          
                         create a sound.                                            
                                                                                    
               He raises the bow to the dead man’s open throat.

                         This sound wasn’t for you or from                          
                         you.  It was from me. My sound.                            
                             (then)                                                 
                         This is my design.                                         
               He runs the bow across the exposed and presented vocal chords, wrapped around the small end of the HEARING HORN intubator, emitting a single chilling note.

                         I give voice to death.                                     
                                                                                    
               CAMERA PULLS BACK over the auditorium as Will Graham bows the        
               dead man’s throat creating an eerie, incandescent sound...           
               ...until CAMERA FINDS GARRET JACOB HOBBS sitting alone. Will         
               abruptly stops playing, then realizes no one else is there.

                         the life of the strings and create
                         a sweeter, more melodic sound.

                         I can hear what he was playing
                         behind my eyes, when I close them.

                         You said the killer was performing.
                         Who was he performing for?

                         I don’t know. Patron of the arts.
                         Fellow musician. Or another killer.
    

                                   HANNIBAL
                         It’s a serenade.

                         One night only.

                         No repeat performance?
    

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         This isn’t how he kills. How he
                         kills, he doesn’t get caught.
    

                                   HANNIBAL
                         You believe he risked getting
                         caught for a serenade?
    

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I believe he wants to show someone
                         how well he plays.

               Will considers how to answer Hannibal’s question, then

               Hannibal ponders the deeper meaning of that, studying Will.

                         This isn’t how he kills. How he
                         kills, he doesn’t get caught.

=== 15 INT. HANNIBAL’S OFFICE - THE NEXT MORNING             15 ===

               Hannibal now sits across from FRANKLYN.

                                   FRANKLYN
                         Remember when I said Tobias was
                         saying dark things?

                                   HANNIBAL
                         I made note of it.

                                   FRANKLYN
                         He said he was gonna cut somebody’s
                         throat and play it like a violin.
               Hannibal stares at FRANKLYN, studying him.

                                   FRANKLYN (CONT’D)
                         They found somebody whose throat
                         was cut and played like a violin.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         FRANKLYN, do you think Tobias
                         killed that man at the symphony?

                                   FRANKLYN
                         I don’t know. I don’t -- I don’t --
                         If I do, do I have to report it?
                                   HANNIBAL
                         Do you have reason not to?

                                   FRANKLYN
                         What if I’m wrong?

                         What if you’re right?

                                   FRANKLYN
                         I’m wrong all the time. Why would
                         he say something like that to me?
                                   HANNIBAL
                         Why do you think?

               FRANKLYN takes longer to say it than to think it.

                                   FRANKLYN
                         Because he knew I would tell you.

               the hook, covers his ears, and the music fades. Then he              
               hears a faint SCRATCHING noise. Will’s eyes open, staring            
               into the middle distance as he listens. Another SCRATCH-SCRATCH.         
                                                                                    
               Will looks at the dogs, who sleep soundly. SCRATCH-SCRATCH.          
               Will opens the front door and listens. SCRATCH.                      
                                                                                    
               There’s nothing outside. Will scans the front porch and yard         
               before finally closing the door. SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRATCH.            
               The dogs still don’t react, even as Will steps over them,            
               searching for the source of the SCRATCHING in the house.             
               Will approaches the chimney wall above the fireplace. He             
               presses his ear against the brick and listens.

                   CAMERA CONTINUES PULLING BACK to FIND Alana Bloom, still
                   wearing her coat, and Will Graham, covered in dust and soot,
                   gazing in at the jagged hole in the chimney. The dogs are
                   all resting on Will’s bed on the other side of the room.
    

                   She nudges a river rock part of the chimney’s structure.
                   Will eyes Alana a moment, curious.
    

                   Will pulls her closer and he brings his lips to hers in a
                   KISS. Alana’s mind reels for a split second before she
                   RETURNS THE KISS. A moment of genuine, careless passion and
                   then Alana’s brow furrows. She breaks off the kiss.

                         What kind of animal was it?

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Might’ve been a raccoon.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Might’ve been?

                         By the time I knocked a hole in the
                         chimney, it crawled out the top.

                   She nudges a river rock part of the chimney’s structure.
                   Will eyes Alana a moment, curious.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Well, at least it got out.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         What are you doing out?

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         Thought I’d make some noise and
                         shoo away any predators at your
                         door but looks like you were making
                         plenty of noise all by yourself.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         You avoided being in a room alone
                         with me, essentially, since I met
                         you. You were smooth about it, too.

                         Evidently not smooth enough.

                         Now you’re making house calls.

                         It’s just a drive-by. On my way
                         home. Since you’re not my patient.

                         I’m confused.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         You have to stop thinking so much.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         I can stop the thinking if we’re
                         not... But if we’re...

                         The way I am in relationships, not
                         that this is a relationship, it’s
                         just a kiss, a great kiss, but the
                         way I am isn’t compatible with....

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         The way I am.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         I wouldn’t be good for you. You
                         wouldn’t be good for me. “We”
                         wouldn’t be good for either of us.
                   She eyes the pile of debris in front of the fireplace.

                         I wouldn’t be able to stop
                         analyzing. I have a professional
                         curiosity about you.

                         me would be... don’t do this. I

                         blunt, Tobias, but I have to ask...                        
                         did you kill that trombonist?

               Hannibal OPENS the DOOR TO REVEAL Will Graham, shaking off

23 INT. HANNIBAL’S HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 3 23

               Hannibal leads Will into the room, surreptitiously looking
               for Tobias. Will notices the half-eaten meals as Hannibal
               shuts the garden door, locks it and pulls the shades before
               Will can see the footsteps in the snow outside.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Did you have a guest?

               Hannibal clears the plates with the half-eaten meals.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Didn’t finish his dinner.

                         An urgent call of some sort. Had
                         to leave suddenly. This benefits
                         you because I have dessert for two.

Hannibal whisks whipped cream and tosses a dollop on two             
               Ramekins overflowing with an exotic bread pudding.

                         anything inside. Alana showed up.

                         changed, I don’t know.

                                   TOBIAS
                         I was aware of him. Baltimore’s a
                         small town and its cultural arts
                         community is even smaller.
               Tobias adjusts a display cello, loosening the balance rod.

                         That’s why we’re here, Mr. Budge.

                         I hear someone cut his throat and
                         tried to play it with a bow.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Why do you say try?

                                   TOBIAS
                         Strings have to be treated. You
                         can’t just open somebody up and run
                         a bow across their innards and
                         expect to produce a sound.

               Will hears the familiar strains of the HAUNTING MELODY rising
               in his ears, trying to focus through it.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         The vocal chords were chemically
                         treated, similar to how catgut
                         strings are treated. We kept those
                         details out of the press.

                                   TOBIAS
                         Looking for someone who knows how
                         to manufacture gut strings?

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Anyone leap to mind?

               Tobias hands Will a bundle of catgut strings, but he doesn’t
               take his eyes off Tobias. Tobias is sensing his suspicion.

                                   TOBIAS
                         Mine are imported from Italy. Best
                         catgut is. The String section of
                         the Baltimore Metropolitan Orchestra
                         refuses to play anything else.

                                   TOBIAS
                         A richer, darker sound. Allows
                         music to say what words can’t.
               Then a HORRIBLE SKIDDING NOISE from outside followed by a
               SICKENING THUMP and the PAINED CRY of a DOG. Will startles.

                                   TOBIAS (CONT’D)
                         Something wrong?

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Sounded like a dog got hit by a
                         car.  You didn’t hear it?

                                   OFFICER STEWART
                         I didn’t hear anything.
               Tobias and the other Police Officer shake their heads “no,”
               they didn’t hear anything either. Another WHIMPERED CRY.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Excuse me a minute.

               Tobias strums the strings of the cello he just straightened
               as he watches Will cross to the door and EXIT.

=== 28 EXT. CHORDOPHONE STRINGS SHOP - DAY 4 - CONTINUOUS      28 ===

               Will steps out of the shop and down the walkway, his eyes
               searching the street for any sign of a commotion or wounded
               animal.  He sees nothing. He hears nothing.
               A PEDESTRIAN eyes Will and keeps moving. Will shakes out
               aspirin into his hand and tosses them back, swallowing hard.
               He rubs his forehead and squints at the snow, worried.

               Finally, he trudges back toward...

               Will Graham ENTERS and is quick to apologize.

               The store is empty. Approaching the counter, he pauses.

               The private room for lessons seen earlier. Will enters to            
               find OFFICER STEWART tumbled over the piano bench, a CELLO           
               ROD jammed under his neck through the top of his head.               
                                                                                    
               Then suddenly, Will hears a strange noise coming from the           
               depths of the obscured STAIRCASE.                                     
               SCRATCH-SCRATCH-SCRATCH...

               Trying to decipher the sound. Gun out in front of him, he            
               moves into the darkness of the stairs until it swallows him.

               Will hugs the wall. He waits till his eyes adjust to the dim         
               light of a single light bulb. But the smell tells him before         
               his eyes can verify what his brain already knows.                    
               This is where Tobias Budge makes his own catgut strings.

               Running the length of the room, drying. Lying in long                
               cleansing troughs of water. Cut strings lying in piles like          
               pasta in pans on a table. An eerie and horrible MAZE OF              
               STRINGS in various stages of treatment.

               And then he hears it again.                                          
               Scratch-scratch-scratch...                                           
                                                                                    
               It's coming from behind an opaque curtain hanging from the           
               ceiling in the corner of the basement. Will approaches               
               cautiously and then slips almost falling.

               He glances down to see what he stepped on. It is OFFICER             
               DORMAU'S BADGE in a pool of blood.

               He throws back the curtain to find Officer Dormau on his             
               knees, dangling forward, supported by a SERIES OF RAZOR-SHARP        
               WIRE STRINGS cutting DEEP INTO HIS FACE AND NECK.                    
                                                                                    
               The Scratch-Scratch-Scratching sound was his intact hand             
               swinging, rubbing against the cement floor -- while his              
               severed and sliced hand whisks back and forth unobstructed.          
                                                                                    
               Scratch-scratch-scratch.                                             
                                                                                    
               Will doesn’t allow himself to be distracted long, turning and        
               scanning the area for any signs of Tobias Budge.                     
               A BLUR OF MOVEMENT out of the corner of Will’s eye. Tobias           
               loops a MULTI-WIRED WEAPON (imagine TWO BRASS KNUCKLES             
               connected by FOUR RAZOR-SHARP STRINGS) over Will’s head.             
                                                                                    
               Will raises an arm defensively over his face and throat, but         
               the STRINGS cut into him regardless. His gun comes up,               
               FIRING next to his own ear and blowing TOBIAS' ear off.              
                                                                                    
               The BANG is deafening, literally. Will’s HEARING GOES DARK           
               AND MUDDY, as he reels from the pain. He clutches his ear            
               with his bloody hand, spinning to find Tobias clutching his          
               own bloody ear. Will raises the gun to fire again and...             
               ...Tobias is already moving, scurrying out of sight. BLAM!           
               Will fires, missing Tobias and blowing a hole in the wall.           
               BLAM! BLAM! Tobias quickly climbs the stairs and disappears.         
                                                                                    
               Will stands there a moment, shaking, as the RINGING in his           
               ear is slowly replaced by the RINGING of SIRENS.

               He is in deep thought, as his fingers count the number of

                         I’m also part of the problem. You                          
                         focus too much on your therapist                           
                         and not enough on your therapy.

                         You lost respect for me because I                          
                         wouldn’t report Tobias, didn’t you?

               Franklyn is surprised to see Tobias standing in the doorway          
               of the PATIENT ENTRANCE, Hannibal less so. Tobias wears a            
               hat and jacket to obscure his bloodied hands and clothes.

                         Tobias...?                                                 
                                                                                    
               Hannibal stands as Tobias moves into the room.

                         I came to say goodbye, Franklyn.

                         What do you mean goodbye? Ohmygod.                         
                         Is that your blood?

                         I just killed two men. The FBI came                        
                         to question me about the murder.

               Hannibal calmly picks up the phone and SMASHES it against Tobias's head.
        

               RAZOR-SHARP PIANO WIRE WHIP
        

               it shreds his coat sleeve.
        

               Moving quickly, he closes the distance, neutralizing the wire.
        

               Dropping low, he thrusts an open palm toward Tobias's mid-section, then glides his hand up his chest toward his chin in a perfect Omega strike.
        

               locks Hannibal's arm in an armbar.
        

               tosses Tobias over the desk, slamming him into the support column.
        

               wrapping the crook of his arm around Tobias's throat, pulling tight.
        

               In the struggle, Tobias's hand finds a LETTER OPENER.
        

               then THROUGH IT, sending Hannibal sprawling backward.
        

               It's brutal and incredibly violent as elbows and knees deliver bone-crunching blows, intercut with the jabbing and slashing of Tobias's letter opener.

               Parrying a thrust, Hannibal eventually opens Tobias's forearm from elbow to wrist with the tip of a ballpoint pen, leaving a jagged, bloody wound.
        

               He moves in tight, wanting to finish this quickly.
        

               As he thrusts his pen towards Tobias's throat, he is surprised by a sharp blow to his carotid artery and stumbles back, his blood pressure dropping as his brain tries to reboot.
        

               In full guard, he rains blows down on Hannibal's head in hopes of ending him.
        

               Holding onto consciousness, he catches one of Tobias's arms and breaks it at the elbow.
        

               retrieves the HEAVY METAL STAG STATUE from its pedestal, bringing it down violently on Tobias's skull with a SICKENING CRACK.

               Hannibal and Tobias squaring off. No one moves.

               We HOLD this incredibly tense beat. And then the phone
               RINGS. It's loud and shrill. Jarring our senses.
               Hannibal calmly picks up the phone and SMASHES it against Tobias's head. Tobias recovers, slashes the air with a
               RAZOR-SHARP PIANO WIRE WHIP pulled from his sleeve. Hannibal
               raises his forearm to block it and it shreds his coat sleeve.

               Moving quickly, he closes the distance, neutralizing the wire.

               Dropping low, he thrusts an open palm toward Tobias's mid-section, then glides his hand up his chest toward his chin in a perfect Omega strike.
               Tobias deflects the death blow at the last second and locks
               Hannibal's arm in an armbar. But Hannibal uses his weight
               advantage against him and tosses Tobias over the desk,
               slamming him into the support column.

               Hannibal vaults over the desk, wrapping the crook of his arm
               around Tobias's throat, pulling tight.

               ON TOBIAS

               He fights to remain conscious as Hannibal locks his legs
               around him increasing the tension on the garrote. In the
               struggle, Tobias's hand finds a LETTER OPENER. He slides it
               beneath Hannibal’s palm, then THROUGH IT, sending Hannibal
               sprawling backward. Tobias goes after him.
               It's brutal and incredibly violent as elbows and knees
               deliver bone-crunching blows, intercut with the jabbing and
               slashing of Tobias's letter opener.

               pressure dropping as his brain tries to reboot.

               TOBIAS

               Lunges forward, tackling Hannibal. In full guard, he rains
               blows down on Hannibal's head in hopes of ending him.
               ON HANNIBAL

               Holding onto consciousness, he catches one of Tobias's arms
               and breaks it at the elbow.

               As Tobias SCREAMS, Hannibal rolls him off and climbs to his
               feet. Bruised and battered, he retrieves the HEAVY METAL
               STAG STATUE from its pedestal, bringing it down violently on
               Tobias's skull with a SICKENING CRACK. Hannibal collapses
               from exhaustion, battered and bloodied.

                         Your patient. Is that who Tobias
                         Budge was serenading?

                                   HANNIBAL
                         I don’t know. Franklyn knew more
                         than he was telling me. He told
                         Mr. Budge he didn’t have to kill
                         anymore. Then he broke Franklyn’s
                         neck.  Then he attacked me.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         And you killed him.

               He eyes with convincing sadness Franklyn’s corpse as it is
               placed into a body bag and hoisted onto a gurney.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Yes.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Could your patient’ve been involved
                         with any of what Budge was doing?

                         I thought this was a simple matter
                         of poor choice in friends.
               Jack eyes Hannibal a brief moment, then turns his attention
               to the crime scene and the TWO BODIES being wheeled out.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         This doesn’t feel simple.

               Jack moves off to study the crime scene as Will sits, taking
               gauze from a med-kit and dabbing Hannibal’s bloody forehead.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I feel like I’ve dragged you into
                         my world.
                                   HANNIBAL
                         I got here on my own. But I
                         appreciate the company.

               OFF Will and Hannibal and their uneasy camaraderie...

               Hannibal sits opposite Bedelia, mid-therapy.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         I’m going to start seeing patients
                         again.  It’s strange thinking about
                         going back to daily practice.

                                   BEDELIA
                         It’s good you stepped away. Even
                         if it was only for a few days.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Patients will sit where Franklyn
                         died.  I will sit where I almost
                         died.  And I will offer therapy.
               Bedelia simply watches Hannibal, saying nothing.

                                   HANNIBAL (CONT’D)
                         It’s easy to understand why you
                         retired after you were attacked.
                             (then)
                         Will you ever feel comfortable
                         returning to psychiatric work?

                                   BEDELIA
                         This is psychiatric work.

                                   HANNIBAL
                         One patient isn’t a practice.
                             (off her silent stare)
                         I can’t help feeling responsible
                         for what happened to Franklyn.

                                   BEDELIA
                         Every person has an intrinsic
                         responsibility for their own life,
                         Hannibal. No one else can take on
                         that responsibility. Not even you.
                                   HANNIBAL
                         Did you take responsibility when
                         you were attacked by your patient?

                                   BEDELIA
                         Yes.  But I don’t take
                         responsibility for his death.

               Hannibal considers that a moment, then:

                                   HANNIBAL
                         Nor should you.
                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
