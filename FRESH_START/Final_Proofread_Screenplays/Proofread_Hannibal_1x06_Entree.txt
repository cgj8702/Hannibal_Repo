                         myself for what happened. I had                            
                         sessions with Gideon for years. He                         
                         sat directly across from me and I                          
                         had no idea what he was hiding.                            
                         And now one of our staff is dead.

                         I imagine after an incident like                           
                         this one, she won’t be holding that                        
                         position much longer.

               That strikes a chord with Jack Crawford, who can relate.

               DR. FREDERICK CHILTON comes around his desk to shake Will
               Graham’s hand as Jack Crawford looks on.
                                   DR. CHILTON
                         Doctor Bloom just called me about
                         you, Mister Graham. Or should I
                         call you Doctor Graham?
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I’m not a doctor.
                                   DR. CHILTON
                         You’re not F.B.I. either. That’s a
                         temporary identification.

                         Mr. Graham teaches at the academy.
                                   DR. CHILTON
                         A teacher. I was relieved to hear
                         from Doctor Bloom, we’ve known each
                         other for years. Take that chair.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Doctor Chilton, we need to see the
                         crime scene while it’s still
                         relatively undisturbed.
                                   DR. CHILTON
                         For something so disturbing, I
                         assure you it’s undisturbed.
                         Medical personnel made sure Nurse
                         Shell wasn’t alive and came right
                         back out. The infirmary has been
                         sealed off until you get there.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Why was a nurse left alone with a
                         prisoner in a high-security
                         psychiatric hospital?
                                   DR. CHILTON
                         For the two years since he was
                         brought here, Gideon behaved
                         perfectly and gave every appearance
                         of cooperating with attempts at
                         therapy. As dictated by our
                         present administrator, security
                         around him was slightly relaxed.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Your present administrator?
                                   DR. CHILTON
                         I imagine after an incident like
                         this one, she won’t be holding that
                         position much longer.
                             (then)

                         myself for what happened. I had

                         Graham needs to see the crime scene
                         in as much privacy as possible.
                                   DR. CHILTON
                         Dr. Bloom assured me that you would
                         cooperate on procedure.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         I will, but I need to be alone.
                                   DR. CHILTON
                         Ah, yes. That thing you do. You
                         are quite the topic of conversation
                         in psychiatric circles.
                                   WILL GRAHAM

                         A unique cocktail of personality
                         disorders and neuroses that makes

                         Graham isn’t here to be analyzed.
                                   DR. CHILTON
                         Perhaps he should be.
                             (to Will)
                         We’re woefully short of material on
                         your sort of thing, Mr. Graham.
                         Would you mind talking with some of
                         the staff -- no, no, not this trip.
                         Dr. Bloom was very severe with me
                         on that point. We’re to leave you
                         alone. Maybe a special visit?
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Thank you, Doctor Chilton. I’d
                         like to see the crime scene now.

               TAB ELECTRODES. As she turns away, Will's eyes OPEN.

               ON THE NURSE:                                                         
                                                                                    
               She hears the heart monitor flatline and turns. Will Graham          
               knocks her OUT OF FRAME, striking her in the throat with the         
               palm of his hand before she can scream.                              
                                                                                    
               The blow is startling and significant in its brutality. It           
               crushes her throat, blocking her airway, and reducing her            
               scream to a painful gurgling.                                        
                                                                                    
               She stumbles back against a medicine cabinet. Eyes wide with         
               fear and pain. But we only see them briefly before Will              
               forces his thumbs into her eye sockets. As her body slumps           
               to the floor, Will stares at the blood on his hands.                 
               Out of the corner of his eye, Will spies Nurse Shell crawling        
               blindly toward the door.                                             
                                                                                    
               Moving to a privacy curtain, Will strips the fabric from the         
               frame and breaks it over his knee to fashion a spear.

                         They say he’s a true sociopath.

                         What do you say?

                         I say they don’t know what else to                         
                         label him. He has some of the                              
                         characteristics of what they call a                        
                         sociopath. No remorse or guilt at                          
                         all. He won’t have any of the other                        
                         marks, he won’t be a drifter. He’ll                        
                         have no history of trouble with the                        
                         law.  He’ll be hard to catch.

                         why he’s so hard to catch.

                         I saw him mainly in court. Wrote                           
                         an article about him for the

                         He’s very familiar with you. He’s                          
                         given you a lot of thought.

                         Yes.  Two. Couple years ago.  When                         
                         he was first institutionalized.

               The STEEL DOOR of the maximum security section closed behind
               Alana Bloom. She hears the bolt slide home.

               ON ALANA BLOOM

               Her footsteps ECHO. High to her right, surveillance cameras.
               On her left, cells. Some are padded, with narrow observation
               slits, others are normal, barred. Shadowy occupants inside.
               DR. GIDEON’S CELL

               Alana approaches. A simple folding chair is positioned in
               front. Behind its barred front wall is a second barrier of
               stout nylon net. Sparse, bolted-down furniture inside.

               DR. Gideon (banal, 50s) is sitting on his bunk, in white
               pajamas. He politely sits upright to greet Alana.

                         I’ve had a lot of psychiatrists

                         red-handed. Literally. No mystery

                         The mystery is whether you are who

                         I never liked being called the
                         Chesapeake Ripper. Maybe something
                         a little more distinct. Any Ripper
                         is going to pale in comparison to
                         the infamous Jack of Whitechapel.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Is that why you didn’t take credit
                         for the Ripper murders before now?

                         from the box seats.

                         Two years of goose-chasing. You
                         must be a very patient man.

                         Are you going to walk me through

                         had my personality inventoried by
                         the Minnesota Multiphasic.

                         Would you prefer a Rorschach test?

                         If you show me those pictures,
                         might I suggest you put a blood
                         pressure cuff on my genitals. Far
                         more accurate gauge to my response.

                         Yes. To both. Are you going to
                         ask me if I’m aroused right now.

                         It would be inconsequential to this
                         line of questioning, Dr. Gideon.
                             (then)
                         Were you sexually aroused when you
                         murdered your wife?
                                   DR. GIDEON
                         She stopped having that effect on
                         me long before I killed her.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         What effect were you hoping to have
                         by killing Elizabeth Shell?

                                   DR. GIDEON
                         That the nurse’s name? The effect
                         I was hoping for was her death.
                             (then)

                         You ate a tube of rheumatoid
                         arthritis ointment for your art.

                                   DR. GIDEON
                         Had to look ill. The capsaicin in
                         the salve irritated my stomach
                         lining so I would sweat profusely.

                         Brutalization of the body was done
                         posthumously. The Chesapeake
                         Ripper usually does that sort of
                         thing during, not after.

                                   DR. GIDEON
                         I don’t need to convince you I’m
                         the Chesapeake Ripper.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Seems that’s what you need to do.
                         It’s certainly what someone needs.

                         thinks she married the right guy.

            Chesapeake Ripper recorded Miriam
            Lass as he was killing her 2 years
            ago. He called me last night at

               The BLACK STAG of his waking nightmare was in fact an                
               approaching Alana Bloom and Jack Crawford.

                         You looked like you were dreaming.

                         Was thinking about something else.                         
                                   JACK CRAWFORD                                    
                         I got something for you to think                           
                         about. We have a medium where we                           
                         can speak to the Chesapeake Ripper.                        
                         Is there a way to push him?

                         Push him toward what?

                         We might be able to influence him                          
                         to blow up and become visible.

                         Could we enrage him?

                         Yes, that is an obstacle. I tried

                         Not personally. I’ll be getting
                         the abbreviated version.

                                   DR. GIDEON
                         Looking for something
                         instructional? Diagrams.  Don’t
                         think I could recreate one of my
                         own murders from memory?
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Wouldn’t be your memory you’d be
                         recreating it from. You’re not the
                         Chesapeake Ripper.

                                   DR. GIDEON
                         We’ll have to agree to disagree.

                         Alright, why the surgical trophies?
                                   DR. GIDEON
                         Well, Agent Crawford, there’re just
                         things you’re not allowed to do in
                         a state certified operating room.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         No trophies from killing your wife
                         and her family at Thanksgiving.
                         You didn’t put them on display.

                         Crimes of passion. You know how
                         stressful the holidays can get.
                         But you’re not here to talk about
                         my wife or even the night nurse.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         What am I here to talk about?

                                   DR. GIDEON
                         Your trainee. Miriam something.

                         Telling me you killed Miriam Lass?

                                   DR. GIDEON
                         I didn’t want to kill her. But
                         yes, I did. Don’t be mad at me.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         I’m not mad at you. I know where
                         you are and how you got here. Not
                         expecting dignified conduct, or
                         even the truth, for that matter.
                         Which you’re being awfully
                         forthcoming about all of a sudden.

                                   DR. GIDEON
                         What do I have to lose? You know
                         where I am and how I got here.
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Why didn’t you put her on display?

                                   DR. GIDEON
                         What makes you think I didn’t?
                         Shouldn’t be so literal about what
                         you consider a display.

               RING.  RING. Jack Crawford’s phone sounds from his pocket.

               Jack looks at his caller ID, which simply reads “HOME.”

                         Polite thing to do is tell them
                         you’ll call them back. Unless, of
                         course, that’s not an option.
               Jack eyes Dr. Gideon, then EXITS.

               Jack steps outside, taking his phone and re-dialing HOME. He
               listens as it RINGS once, twice then picks up:

                         Sorry I couldn’t pick up. You’re
                         home early. Everything alright?

               An eerie moment of room tone, then a recorded voice:

                         He was in my home. He was in my
                         bedroom. He sat where my wife
                         sleeps.  He touched her pillow.

                         Did Miriam Lass know where you live?

                         If she wanted to know, she was
                         smart enough to find out.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Could’ve told the Chesapeake Ripper
                         before he killed her. Did you know
                         you were sending her after him?
                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         I sent her after information.

                         She was my trainee. I am
                         responsible for her death.

                         The Ripper didn’t just touch her
                         pillow.  He put his head on it.
                         Somebody’s been sleeping in your bed.

               Beverly plucks a long blonde hair from the indentation in the
               pillow lying on Bella Crawford’s side of the bed.

                         I left a report here for you last
                         night.  I don’t know if you got it.

                         here you should be sitting in a

                         What you’re proposing in your
                         report breaks confidentiality laws.
                         You shouldn’t be so dismissive
                         about what you’re learning here.

                         If the Chesapeake Ripper is a
                         surgeon, we should look at medical
                         records of all the known victims.
                         I know we wouldn’t get a warrant
                         without something substantial --

                         It’s one thing for a trainee to go
                         poking around private medical
                         records without a warrant, very
                         much another if “The Guru” did it.
               That stops Miriam. She’s getting it.

                         Better for a Trainee to ask for
                         forgiveness than an FBI agent to
                         ask for permission?

               Alana Bloom sits outside of Dr. Gideon’s cell as he sits
               inside, watching her closely as he listens.

                         ...to subvert your sense of control,
                         you may not realize it unless those
                         methods are pointed out to you.

                                   DR. GIDEON
                         Which might in fact be a
                         manipulative method of itself.

                         You were a model patient. You
                         behaved yourself for two years.
                                   DR. GIDEON
                         No opportunity to misbehave.

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         You could have been pushed.

                                   DR. GIDEON
                         Unethically?

                                   ALANA BLOOM
                         I can help you find out. But I
                         need your trust to do that.
                                   DR. GIDEON
                         I trust you, Dr. Bloom.

               OFF that statement, neither of them believes is entirely true:

38 EXT. ABANDONED OBSERVATORY - DAY 38

               CAMERA FOLLOWS Beverly Katz and Will Graham as they approach
               the abandoned building; Jack Crawford hangs back considering
               what they may find. VARIOUS FBI AGENTS in the background.

                         The last call was made to Jack’s
                         cell from a disposable phone traced
                         here. Or within a 100 feet of here.

                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         What was Miriam Lass looking into?

                         Medical records. If the Ripper was
                         a surgeon, she thought he might
                         have treated one of his victims.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         They retraced her steps?

                                   BEVERLY KATZ
                         The ones they could find. She made
                         a jump somewhere they couldn’t
                         explain. You make those jumps.

                         The evidence has to be there.

                         Every surgeon that came into
                         contact with any of the Ripper
                         victims has been thoroughly vetted
                         and or currently under observation.
                                   WILL GRAHAM
                         Including Dr. Gideon.

               Jack approaches, solemn.

                                   JACK CRAWFORD
                         Dr. Gideon wasn’t in my bedroom.
                         The Chesapeake Ripper was.
               Jack takes his phone out of his coat pocket.

                         That last call left something the
                         others didn’t. A phone number.

               Jack presses call. An uncomfortably long beat. Jack is
               about to end the call, then... A DISTANT RING. And ANOTHER.

               Jack, Will and the FBI AGENTS turn toward the Observatory.

A39 INT. ABANDONED OBSERVATORY - DAY A39
               Empty. Neglected ASTRONOMY EQUIPMENT and the MACHINES THAT
               REPAIR THEM lay long dormant, dust-covered.

               The RING continues as CAMERA FINDS Jack and Will. Jack moves
               ahead of Will toward the source of the RING and then slows,
               becoming suddenly hesitant about what he might discover.

               Then the RING STOPS.

               He hardens his resolve as he sees under the TELESCOPE:

               A HAND HOLDING A CELL PHONE
               Slightly discolored, like recently greying pig flesh. CAMERA
               REVEALS the hand is attached to a severed arm, nothing else.

               ON JACK CRAWFORD AND WILL GRAHAM

               Next to the arm, under the telescope is a sign with a simple
               note that reads: “What do you see?” Jack drops his head.

                         worked.  I thought she was alive.                          
                         For a moment, anyway. I allowed                            
                         myself to believe what I knew was                          
                         impossible. I got played.

                         Indulge me. Talk to me about her.                          
                         What was her name?

                         I was hoping to talk to you about a                        
                         former patient, not necessarily one                        
                         of yours, but someone you might                            
                         have come in contact with. When                            
                         you were a practicing physician.

                         I haven’t practiced medicine in                            
                         some time, but fortunately for you                         
                         I have a very good memory.

                         Perhaps not so good a memory after                         
                         all.  I don’t recall a patient with                        
                         that name, but it sounds familiar.

                         his workshop. We think he may be a

                         Ah.  That’s why he sounds familiar.                        
                         It’s been all over the news.

                         It’s been a long time since the                            
                         accident, but I thought you might                          
                         remember if anything seemed fishy                          
                         about the arrow wound.

                         of, I vaguely remember a fellow                            
                         hunter bringing him in. But I                              
                         recall very little else.

                         Figured it was a long shot.

                         I did keep detailed journals during                        
                         those days. If you like, I can get                         
                         them for you. Maybe you’ll find                            
                         something helpful.

                         I’ll be right back.

               Hannibal crosses to the ladder and climbs up to the second

                         Her face goes slack, recognizing the connection between the murdered man in the workshop and Hannibal Lecter’s sketch.

               where it FINDS HANNIBAL’S SOCKED FEET padding across the room quietly and quickly toward Miriam, sneaking up behind her.

               They reach out, hanging briefly in the air, and then SNATCH.
               Hannibal coils around Miriam quickly and violently, yet with elegant precision, hoisting her off her feet. She cries out but her YELP is cut short. She kicks violently, legs swinging, sending the table and pencil drawings into the air.
               Hannibal is like a column of marble, motionless as Miriam twists and throws, trying in vain to knock him off balance.
               She reaches behind her head, clawing at Hannibal but he presses his face almost sensually against the back of her neck to protect face and eyes from her slashing fingernails.
                                                                                    
               Miriam’s eyes roll, defeated, tear-filled, knowing she’s going to die. She begins to go limp in Hannibal’s arms.
