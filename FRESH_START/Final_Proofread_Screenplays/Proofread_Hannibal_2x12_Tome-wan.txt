               SUCKLING PIG swaddled in a blanket on his lap. MASON VERGER,         
               bloody-nosed and annoyed, stares at a confident Will.

                         about me. Killing you would just                           
                         be a hoop for me to jump through.

                         you're not particularly likable.

                         I'm not deceiving you, Dr. Lecter.                         
                         I'm just pointing out the snare                            
                         around your neck. What you do                              
                         about it is entirely up to you.

                         You put the snare around my neck.

                         Why did you tell Mason Verger I                            
                         want to kill him?

                         I was curious what would happen.                           
                             (then)                                                 
                         It's true, isn't it? You do want                           
                         to kill him. Or you want me to.                            
                         Either way, you'd like him dead.                           
                         I'm just giving you a little nudge.

                         as the Bible says. Papa taught me                          
                         how to hide all sorts of things.

                         You have to find meaning in what's                         
                         happened, Margot.                                          
               Margot considers that a moment, then:                                
                                                                                    
                                   MARGOT VERGER                                    
                         Mason bears a strong resemblance to                        
                         our father. Shiny eyebrows and pale                        
                         blue butcher's eyes. I was dreading                        
                         seeing either of them in my child.                         
                                                                                    
                                   HANNIBAL                                         
                         You will ruminate on the image of                          
                         that child, whom you have never                            
                         seen, and you will compare that                            
                         image to every child you ever see.                         
               Hannibal's gaze falls on Will, who realizes the doctor is            
               speaking as much to him as he is Margot.

                         This won't make you human, Margot,                         
                         so much as give you the ability to                         
                         make yourself human and move on.

                         There's no resolve to this.                                
                         There's no resolution.

                         Moving on isn't just a distraction,                        
                         it's a rebuke. Show your brother                           
                         how strong you are. Survive him.

                         As you allow your emotions to                              
                         unfold, you have to hone in on what                        
                         can be, rather than what was done.                         
               CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Hannibal...

               CAMERA moves around him to reveal he now stands --

                         Hannibal has a certain personality                         
                         style the rest of us can learn

In moderation, of course.

                         You saying Dr. Lecter's got too                            
                         much of a good thing?

                         You can't glamorize him. And you                           
                         can't dehumanize him, either.

                         All I want to do is catch him.

                         He's given me nothing actionable,                          
                         Jack.  He's confessed to nothing.                          
                         He's acknowledged only vagaries.

                         I need more than vagaries. You've                          
                         killed someone, Will.                                      
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         Who was trying to kill me.

                         I don't know if I can prove that.                          
                         You mutilated his body. We made a                          
                         public spectacle of Freddie Lounds's                       
                         death.  I'm out on a limb. And that                        
                         limb is going to break. I've only                          
                         told the OIG what they need to know.                       
                         What haven't you told me?                                  
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         Hannibal is trying to manipulate me                        
                         into murdering one of his patients.                        
                         Mason Verger. I can manipulate                             
                         Hannibal into killing him instead.                         
                                   JACK CRAWFORD                                    
                         What's Verger done?                                        
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         Hannibal considers him rude.                               
                         That's motive enough. It's as                              
                         though committing murders has                              
                         purged him of lesser rudeness.

                         You're talking about putting a                             
                         man's life in danger.
