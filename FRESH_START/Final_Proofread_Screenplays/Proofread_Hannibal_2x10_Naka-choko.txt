    He scrambles out of the way.
    **The** BLACK STAG
    

    Its **antlers** slam into the wall on either side of Will and
    pierce it. CAMERA reveals the black stag is now the MAN
    STAG. They are terrifyingly face to face for a moment. A
    man and his nemesis.
    

    And then Will --
    
    **Head-butts** the man stag, hard and sudden, in the face, and it
    staggers back as Will drives it to the ground.
    

    As his fists **pummel** the man stag, we see, in brief FLASHES,
    HANNIBAL LECTER staring back at Will, grinning a bloody grin.

    Until we find **drops** OF BLOOD, thick and viscous, on the floor.
    

    A nightmarish form of a man's head, **eyes** STARING, with the

                         Without death, we'd be at a loss.                          
                         It's the prospect of death that                            
                         drives us to greatness.

               bruised hands are submerged, tinging the water pink.

               body still splayed across it. Hannibal removes Will's hands          
               from the Epsom salts bath, drying them. Will stares absently         
               as Hannibal treats his wounds. Hannibal clocks the retreat.
