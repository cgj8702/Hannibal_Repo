Refusing to turn away, a penance of sorts.

                                   WILL GRAHAM (O.S.)                               
                         Jack.                                                      
                                                                                    
               Jack turns, scarcely daring to believe he heard right.               
                                                                                    
               WILL GRAHAM                                                          
                                                                                    
               Stands just beyond the police barriers. Tired, showing the           
               bruises of his fall from the train.                                  
                                                                                    
               Jack has to fight a sudden urge, to run and hug Will, that           
               surprised him. Huge relief.                                          
               He smiles at Will and Will returns it. Both men surprised            
               how strongly they feel. And then guilt hits them both and            
               they look to Pazzi.                                                  
                                                                                    
               Jack nods to an Italian cop and motions Will under the               
               barrier tape.

               Jack and Will move through the shattered interior of the             
               Atrocious Torture Exhibit where Jack and Hannibal did battle.

                         He's wounded and worried.

                         Hannibal doesn't worry. Knowing                            
                         he's in danger won't rattle him any                        
                         more than killing does.                                    
                                                                                    
               Jack examines the vintage WOODCARVING of Pazzi's ancestor            
               hanging, disemboweled.

                         If Rinaldo Pazzi decided to do his                         
                         duty as an officer of the law, he                          
                         could have detained Dr. Fell and                           
                         determined very quickly that he was                        
                         Hannibal Lecter. Would have taken                          
                         thirty minutes to get a warrant.

                         All those resources were denied to                         
                         Pazzi.  Once he decided to sell                            
                         Hannibal, he became a bounty hunter.

                         Have you told la polizia they're                           
                         looking for Hannibal Lecter?

                         They're motivated to find Dr. Fell                         
                         inside the law. Knowing who he                             
                         is... and what he's worth, will                            
                         just coax them out of bounds.

                         It would be a free-for-all.

                         And Hannibal would slip away.                              
                         Would you slip away with him?

                         Part of me will always want to.

                         You have to cut that part out.                             
                                                                                    
               Will looks around the displays of torture instruments.               
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         Of course you would find him here.                         
                         Not because of the exhibit, but                            
                         because of the crowd it attracts.                          
                                                                                    
               Jack watches Will as he moves behind a STARVATION CAGE,              
               appearing as though he's trapped inside.                             
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM (CONT’D)                             
                         You had him, Jack. He was beaten.

                         business. He was a pioneer in                              
                         livestock production, I'm sure he's                        
                         eaten someone. Yet I must admit a                          
                         tremble at the notion myself.

                         Many are eager to believe Pazzi                            
                         killed himself, binding his own                            
                         hands in the manner of jail suicide.

                         We know it was murder. And perhaps                         
                         most poetically, the Italian public

                         The Italian public is right.

                         missing men. My husband knew him.                          
                         We've been to his home many times.                         
                                                                                    
               That last sentence is directed solely at Jack.

                         We believe your husband was                                
                         responsible for the disappearances,                        
                         and murdered Commendator Pazzi when                        
                         he came to the same conclusion.                            
               Bedelia reacts, allowing tears of confusion to flow. Jack

                         If you knew Dr. Fell to be Hannibal                        
                         Lecter, why didn't you bring it to                         
                         the attention of the Questura?

                         There's a price on his head. Pazzi                         
                         knew.  He tried to sell him. That                          
                         kind of money, can't say I blame him.                      
                             (then)                                                 
                         Can you?                                                   
               A tense moment as Benetti decides to ignore the challenge.

                         Signor Crawford. Since you're not

               Jack stands and, shortly thereafter, Bedelia stands and              
               starts to follow him out.

                         Not you, Signora Fell. You stay                            
                         right where you are.                                       
               Jack glances back at Bedelia who sits down again, surrounded         
               by Florentine police.

               Into a room that slides IN AND OUT OF FOCUS.                         
                                                                                    
               BLOOD runs down FINGERS and DROPS in thick SPATTERS onto a           
               polished floor.

               As Hannibal brings Will into the room.                               
                                                                                    
               Will's shirt beneath his coat is soaked with blood. It runs          
               down his sleeve and drips from his fingers.

               Hannibal maneuvers Will onto the couch, where Will lies back.

               HAZY -- as Hannibal moves away and comes back with water in a        
               glass.  He tenderly holds it to Will's lips.

                         The bullet is still inside you.                            
                         This will hurt.                                            
               He pulls Will forward and strips Will's coat from his                
               shoulders, exposing the bullet wound and also effectively            
               trapping Will's arms.                                                
                                                                                    
               Again, Will watches as Hannibal cuts Will's shirt away and we        
               see the ugly bullet wound. Still oozing blood. Will endures          
               the pain beneath Hannibal's touch. The intimacy is striking.

               Hannibal places Will's knife in his limp hand.

               Will stares at the blade in the nerve-damaged hand of his            
               trapped arm. They look at one another for a tense moment.

               Will Graham's eyes open and he looks to where Hannibal can be        
               seen, only feet away, yet it seems a great distance. His             
               image GHOSTS in a conscious replaying of Hannibal in the             
               Teaser.  Both men are battered and bruised.                          
                                                                                    
               Will sits in front of Sogliato's fine white linen, china and         
               silver, leaving GHOSTLY IMAGES of his slow progress behind.          
                                                                                    
               Hannibal produces a fine syringe and injects Will's arm once         
               more.  Will swoons, and Hannibal uses a strap already                
               fastened to the chair back to pinion Will to the chair.

               As the room swims and Hannibal's face MORPHS INTO WILL'S OWN         
               FACE and then back again.

                         I do not indulge much in regret,                           
                         but I am sorry to be leaving Italy.                        
                         There were things in the Palazzo                           
                         Capponi I would have liked to read.                        
               Hannibal returns and places a small tureen in front of Will.

                         clavier and perhaps compose. I                             
                         might have cooked for the Widow                            
                         Pazzi, when she overcame her grief.

               Hannibal raises a straw to Will's lips. Will sips.

                         The soup isn't very good.

                         It's a parsley-and-thyme infusion,                         
                         and more for my sake than yours.                           
                         Have another sip, let it circulate.                        
                                                                                    
               Will does so. Pliable to Hannibal's wishes. Will notes a             
               third place setting at the other end of the table.

               Checking a directory displayed on the wall, he finds the name

               As the door begins to slide shut, a hand suddenly reaches in         
               to stop it.

               Steps into the elevator with her rifle case, standing right          
               beside Jack, both of them looking straight ahead.

               A cheerful DING heralds its arrival.                                 
                                                                                    
               The door opens. Jack holds it open for Chiyoh who                    
               reluctantly walks out. Jack watches her go. He allows the            
               elevator door to close and follows Chiyoh.                           
                                                                                    
               She moves down the hall and, as she approaches the stairway          
               landing, she pauses. She glances back at Jack.

               Chiyoh casually descends the stairs, aware that Jack is              
               watching her suspiciously. He considers a moment, then               
               continues down the hall.

               He touches the door... which swings open. He sneaks inside.

               Hearing the soft music coming from the dining room, he heads

               The sight of Will sitting at the table -- drugged and bound,         
               his head dropped -- stops Jack cold. He creeps into the              
               room, listening for any sound of Hannibal. All we can hear           
               is the sizzle of butter.

                         Looks different with a beard, no?

                         That's not my husband.

                         I've never considered myself in                            
                         need of rescuing until now.

                         My husband was hoping to meet a                            
                         friend before he left Florence.

                         The nature of their meeting                                
                         requires privacy. They'll be                               
                         somewhere no one's supposed to be.

               The music is still playing softly as Jack comes round to find        
               himself seated way down at the opposite end of the table from        
               Will.                                                                
                                                                                    
               Not far from Jack, Hannibal is busy at his burners, scraping         
               minced caper berries into the sizzling pan.                          
               Jack makes to move and his face falls in frustration and then        
               sudden fear as he realizes he cannot move.

               Hannibal smiles and pours Will a glass of wine. Will raises it

               We will play the scene between their lucid POV and Will's

               Hannibal pours himself a glass of wine now and takes a               
               leisurely sip.

                         But the menu was all wrong.

               Putting down his wine, he picks up a diabolical-looking

                         Jack was the first to suggest                              
                         getting inside your head.                                  
                                                                                    
               Hannibal looks down at Will. Then, fondly, and with real regret:

                         Now we both have the opportunity to                        
                         chew quite literally what we've

               With the flick of a switch, Hannibal REVS up the bone saw.           
               Wielding the bone saw, Hannibal approaches Will, the elegant

               Hannibal brings the SCREAMING bone saw, with its madly-              
               spinning, serrated blade, toward Will's head...

               Jack's screaming face -- but no sound emerges.

               Blood floats upward in floating BUBBLES suspended over the           
               table and, in them, he sees reflections -- Jack, Hannibal,           
               himself and the Wendigo.

               fisheye-style as Hannibal leans over him.                            
               ON WILL -- still, as the room seems to SPIN faster and faster        
               round him, as if the WHINE is of the room spinning, not the          
               blade.  And as his eyes finally close...

               TOWERING TREES racing past us, enveloping us in leafy canopies       
               as we seemingly venture deep into dark, primal woods.

               Twin rows of GUTTED PIG CARCASSES hang in plastic wrapping           
               from a rail in the roof of the darkened space.                       
                                                                                    
               The TICK and HUM of refrigeration can be heard in the metal box.     
                                                                                    
               A sudden CLANG as the door is opened and a gust of frosted           
               air is expelled into the dark space beyond -- unclear behind         
               the beams of a powerful light.                                       
                                                                                    
               A WHIRRING noise can be heard.                                       
               WILL GRAHAM                                                          
                                                                                    
               Face in repose. CAMERA PULLS AWAY from him, CORKSCREWING to          
               reveal that Will is actually HANGING UPSIDE DOWN like the            
               carcasses, Hannibal alongside him, similarly trussed.                
                                                                                    
               The WHIRRING continues and the carcasses swing sideways as a         
               silhouetted shape moves through them to reveal --
