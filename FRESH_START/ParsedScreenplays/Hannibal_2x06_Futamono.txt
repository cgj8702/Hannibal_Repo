               CLOSE-UP -- A HAND plays along the white-on-black keys of a          
               harpsichord. As it moves up the scale, CAMERA follows at             
               CLOSE FOCUS, only three or four keys sharp as they are played.       
               EXTREME CLOSE-UPS -- a key is depressed. It rocks on a PIVOT         
               and lifts the JACK at the other end to which a PLECTRUM is           
               attached.                                                            
                                                                                    
               The plectrum plucks a string which VIBRATES and a note               
               sounds.  As the jack falls again, the plectrum raises.               
                                                                                    
               TRAVEL ACROSS the strings as the scale continues, as each            
               jack raises and a string is plucked. Rhythmic and hypnotic.          
               The scale becomes a melody and now seemingly-random jacks            
               rise and fall as the strings are plucked.                            
               The hands move across the keyboards. We see STITCHED WOUNDS in       
               the wrists, still raw. A spot of blood WEEPS onto the keys.          
                                                                                    
               A SOMBER REFRAIN moves toward a lighter, more-uplifting              
               sound.  And then STOPS. The dampers fall on the strings and          
               silence is sudden. The echo of the music still in the air.

               musical notation. He lifts a fountain pen and carefully              
               marks the next few notes.                                            
               EXTREMELY CLOSE as the pen blooms and draws the notes, ink           
               soaking into the heavyweight paper...

                         She'll be alive for as long as she                         
                         wants to be. Not a moment of that                          
                         will be negotiable to you or me.                           
                                                                                    
               Jack considers that a moment, then:

                         You gave me my wife back, Hannibal,                        
                         then the Ripper took Beverly. Can't                        
                         help feeling one paid for the next.

                         me the night I was in the hospital                         
                         with Bella. She knew I was there,                          
                         she knew who I was there with.

                         There is no causal relation between                        
                         Bella's life and Beverly's death.                          
               Jack is not so sure that is true.

                         If Bella had died, Beverly would                           
                         have found me. Bella lived.  So                            
                         Beverly left me alone with my wife.                        
                         What she did next got her killed.

                         You can't take that on, Jack.

                         Not taking it on. I'm making note.

                         What you're making are connections                         
                         where there aren't any.

                         There are connections. There is a                          
                         pattern taking shape and I just                            
                         have to convince my eyes to see it.

                         I've convinced myself of something                         
                         I refused to see for a long time.

                         All it took was Will Graham trying                         
                         to kill you to see it?

                         Yes.  I can't help Will. I can't                           
                         trust him. He's in a dark place                            
                         where the shadows move. It's not                           
                         safe to stand with him anymore.

                         He knows something's there. In the                         
                         shadows. Close to him.  But he                             
                         can't see it. I feel the same way.                         
                             (then)                                                 
                         We found another Ripper victim. A                          
                         Baltimore councilman.

                         I'm sorry, Jack. I can't.  Not                             
                         only do I have to let Will go, I                           
                         have to let this all go. I nearly                          
                         died.  Would have if it weren't for                        
                         you.  Can't dwell on death anymore.

                         I don't blame you.                                         
               Hannibal puts down his drink. Turns to Jack.

                         room?  An ostentatious herb garden,                        
                         Leda and the Swan over the                                 
                         fireplace. And you.  Having a fit                          
                         in the corner. That's where I asked                        
                         him if he was the Chesapeake Ripper.                       
                         And he avoided the question by                             
                         suggesting I kill Alana Bloom.

                         I'll tell Jack Crawford everything                         
                         if you tell me why Hannibal did it.

                         He wanted to see what would happen.                        
                         If you did kill Alana. Or if I                             
                         killed you. He was just curious.                           
                             (then)                                                 
                         And you saved his life.

                         No, it doesn't. Chesapeake Ripper                          
                         is murdering again and Hannibal

                         He fits the profile. He's attracted

                         because they offer power over man.

               CAMERA PUSHES IN ON Hannibal performing the latest evolution         
               of his composition. The piece is tonally charged, but bent           
               toward obscuring obvious key centers and harmonic and melodic        
               traditions. Very much an extension of his own personality.

                         The one thing I have clarity on is,                        
                         Will Graham tried to kill Hannibal.

                         And he believes it was a righteous                         
                         act.  May be guilty, but he doesn't                        
                         feel guilty about that call.

                         That says more about Will than it                          
                         does about Hannibal. If you're                             
                         worried about him, talk to his                             
                         psychiatrist. He gave you consent.

                         We can't find Dr. Du Maurier. Left                         
                         notice she would be traveling and                          
                         would prefer not to be contacted.

                         Why'd you say it like that, Jack?                          
                                                                                    
               Jack more or less ignores the question, turning to the dogs.         
               There appears to be one more dog in the pack.

                         Hannibal has been a teacher, a                             
                         mentor and a friend. I knew him

                         and he's not scared. Not anymore.

               Hannibal Lecter is standing outside Will Graham's cage.

                         I feel like I've been watching our                         
                         friendship on a split screen. The                          
                         friendship I perceived on one side                         
                         and the truth on the other.

                         It's a terrible feeling, isn't it?

                         You've been lying to me, Will.

                         I don't have a gauge for reality                           
                         that works well enough to know if                          
                         I've been lying or not.

                         You understand the reality of                              
                         Beverly Katz's death. You                                  
                         understand your role in that.                              
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         What was my role?

                         Beverly died at your behest.                               
                         You're as angry with yourself as                           
                         you are with whoever murdered her.

                         Actually, I'm not. I'm singularly                          
                         angry at whoever murdered her.

                         You tried to kill me, Will. It's                           
                         hard not to take that personally.                          
                         However, if I were Beverly's                               
                         murderer, I'd applaud your effort.

                         I'm no more guilty of what you've                          
                         accused me of than you are of what                         
                         I have accused you of.

                         end, Dr. Lecter? With a final act                          
                         or the events that led to it?

                         I don't expect you to feel self-                           
                         loathing or regret or shame. You                           
                         knew what you were doing and you                           
                         made your own decisions. Decisions                         
                         that were under your control.

                         You think I'm in control?

                         I think you're more in control now                         
                         than you've ever been.

                         You found a way to hurt me, Will.                          
                         I wonder how many more people are                          
                         going to be hurt by what you do.

               Dr. Chilton chimes in from where he’s perched near the wall.

                         Do you mean your book, Frederick?

                         Yes.                                                       
                                                                                    
               Gideon turns to Jack, ignoring Chilton:

                         Life’s too slippery for books,                             
                         Agent Crawford. Anger appears as                           
                         lust, lupus presents as hives. How                         
                         does Dr. Chilton present?                                  
               Jack’s patience is growing thin.

                         I respect Dr. Chilton’s opinion.

                         Would you say Dr. Chilton is beyond                        
                         reproach? Before you answer that,                          
                         I’d like to note, the term                                 
                         "sociopath" hasn’t been used by any                        
                         respectable psychiatrist since 1968.

                         Dr. Gideon, do you have information                        
                         about the Chesapeake Ripper?

                         Down to brass tacks.                                       
                                                                                    
                                   JACK CRAWFORD                                    
                         You told Will Graham you were in                           
                         Lecter’s home. Why were you there?                         
               Gideon doesn’t so much as glance at Chilton when he answers:         
                                                                                    
                                   DR. GIDEON                                       
                         I’ve never set foot in Hannibal                            
                         Lecter’s house. I only just met                            
                         the man last week. However, Dr.                            
                         Chilton was kind enough to share                           
                         the details of his dining room.                            
                                                                                    
                                   JACK CRAWFORD                                    
                         Why would he do that?                                      
                                                                                    
                                   DR. CHILTON                                      
                         Yes, why would I do that?

                                   DR. GIDEON                                       
                         Mr. Graham has been keen to believe                        
                         Hannibal Lecter is the Chesapeake                          
                         Ripper.  Dr. Chilton is doing little                       
                         to disavow him of that notion and                          
                         encouraged me to do the same.                              
               Dr. Chilton stares, unimpressed. He doesn’t let Dr. Gideon           
               get the best of him. He crosses to Jack nearer the cage.             
                                                                                    
                                   DR. CHILTON                                      
                         I apologize, Agent Crawford, for                           
                         wasting your time.                                         
                                   DR. GIDEON                                       
                         It’s not your actions or betrayal I                        
                         resent, Dr. Chilton, it’s the lies.                        
                                                                                    
                                   DR. CHILTON                                      
                             (to Jack)                                              
                         I’ll walk you out.                                         
                                                                                    
               Dr. Chilton leads Jack across the therapy hall to the stairs.        
                                                                                    
                                   DR. GIDEON                                       
                         Dr. Chilton hired a nurse who’s had                        
                         experience in mental hospitals, but                        
                         not as an employee. That nurse                             
                         attempted to murder Hannibal Lecter                        
                         and you blame Will Graham. You’ve                          
                         got the right box, Jack, but you’re                        
                         looking in the wrong corner.                               
               Jack and Chilton continue up the stairs. With some finality,         
               Dr. Gideon addresses Dr. Chilton before he can exit:                 
                                                                                    
                                   DR. GIDEON (CONT’D)                              
                         Suppose you’ll have me beaten again                        
                         for this, won’t you, Frederick?

               Gideon and TWO GUARDS come into the stairwell. They hold him

                         No.  This is good.

               Hannibal nods to the server who moves off.

               Jack watches Hannibal. The server returns with a Tupperware          
               with a lid. Jack takes it in his hands.

               Jack takes a latex glove from his pocket and uses it to place        
               food into the Tupperware. Hannibal glances across the room           
               to see Dr. Chilton watching the exchange curiously.                  
                                                                                    
               As Jack seals the container, Hannibal smiles sadly.

               Jack holds the food container as he greets Brian Zeller and          
               Jimmy Price who are emerging from evidence processing.

               A DISTINCTIVE NOTE of a harpsichord punctuates the exchange.

               The room has been tidied, but evidence of the party remains.         
               Alana sits at Hannibal's harpsichord, doubling the KEYS she's        
               playing until it becomes clear she's performing a slow,              
               dreamy version of "Chopsticks." Hannibal slides next to her.         
                                                                                    
               She smiles and he watches her for a moment, then starts              
               playing his composition at the opposite end of the keyboard.

                         The ending to my composition has                           
                         been alluding me. You may have

               They smile as they play, hands crossing over the keys,               
               pushing their shoulders together.

               Alana turns to face Hannibal. He feels her gaze and turns to

               And then he returns the kiss, passionate, alive.

               Gideon's eyes open as FOOTSTEPS squeak on the floor.

               He sees a tall SHADOW behind the CURTAINS as it approaches.          
               He watches as the shadow moves toward the foot of the bed.

               The curtains are drawn back and a tall figure in surgical            
               scrubs, gloves and a MASK stands before him.

               Early morning light begins to creep through the windows.             
               CAMERA PUSHES IN ON the curtains surrounding Gideon's bed, a         
               GHOULISH SILHOUETTE hangs beyond them. A FLASH ignites behind        
               the curtain, the silhouettes of TWO MEN examining the body.          
                                                                                    
               REVERSE to reveal Jack Crawford as he approaches. He opens           
               the curtains to find Brian Zeller taking forensic photos of          
               the body as Jimmy Price dusts for fingerprints.                      
                                                                                    
               THE BODY                                                             
               It seems to be floating on his belly, horizontally suspended         
               two feet above the bed. His skin is pinched/stretched/pulled         
               many different directions by WIRE FISHING LEADERS. Each line         
               ends in a handcrafted HOOK -- the barb pushed through the            
               skin of the dead man's back, arms and legs.                          
                                                                                    
               But that dead man is not Abel Gideon. Instead, it is a               
               BALTIMORE POLICE OFFICER, his gun belt still around the waist        
               of his uniform pants. His torso is BARE and opened, the skin         
               held back in flaps attached by fishhooks. The contents of            
               his abdomen on the bed below, his badge sits on top.                 
               The finger clip from the MONITORS is attached to his hand.

                         Put a heart monitor on the guard so                        
                         no one'd know Gideon was missing,                          
                         least for as long as it took the                           
                         guard to die, which wasn't long.

                         the ones Will Graham used to make.                         
                         This one has human hair. A tooth.

                         There's no way Gideon could have                           
                         done any of this with his injuries,

               CLOSE ON ALANA asleep in Hannibal's bed. She stirs slightly          
               and slowly opens her eyes. CAMERA DRIFTS around the bed,             
               finally revealing Hannibal sleeping quietly next to her.             
               Alana stares peacefully at the ceiling, the morning after            
               sleeping with a friend. As she begins to think too much, she         
               realizes Hannibal has opened his eyes and is watching her.

                         how they often make us want sex.

                         It's one in the eye for death.

                         Not that we... not that this was...                        
                         funeral sex.

                         Of course it was. We both just                             
                         buried a friend. We buried Will.

                         There's something liberating about                         
                         finally letting him go.

               He kisses her, then stops and looks at her reassuringly:

                         Last time someone rang my doorbell                         
                         this early, it was a census taker.                         
                                                                                    
               Hannibal goes to the curtains and draws them -- revealing the        
               morning sun and allowing it to spill into the room.

               CLOSE ON three loud RAPS on a heavy oak door.                        
               The peephole goes dark, then -- Hannibal opens the door to           
               find Jack Crawford standing outside.

               Jack turns. He flashes surprise, but tamps it quickly.

                         I was here with Hannibal all night,                        
                         Jack.  What are you accusing him of?                       
               Hannibal reads Jack's frustration and perhaps relief.

               Moonlight on crisp white snow. The hulking black shadow of a         
               heavily-built wooden barn stands stark against the white.            
                                                                                    
               CRANE DOWN and around, as we hear the low rumble of a car

               barred on the outside. Jack pulls out his gun and a Maglite          
               and walks toward it, his feet crunching on the snow. His

               Blackness, except for slivers of faint moonlight shining             
               through the wooden beams. We hear the sound of the heavy bar

               A rending sound of wood and metal.                                   
                                                                                    
               A door opens to reveal a flight of wooden stairs, looking up         
               at Jack Crawford. We are --

               He throws down the iron bar he used to force the lock.               
               Shines his light right at us as he starts down the stairs --         
               Jack moves down the wooden stairs, gun and flashlight before         
               him.  CAMERA recedes before him to reveal a dark, low cellar         
               space, the concrete floor dominated by the tops of two               
               circular WATER CISTERNS.                                             
                                                                                    
               Jack scans the room, his flashlight beam our only light source,      
               casting harsh shadows and movements. He checks the room for          
               danger -- light reflecting off dirt-smeared windows in the far       
               wall; blackness reflecting back from the other side.

               Jack stills as he hears it. Heart thumping. A scraping sound.

               He moves to the cisterns, the old stone topped with much             
               newer METAL LIDS.                                                    
                                                                                    
               He pulls the first one off -- flashes the light into it --           
               dark water rises a third of the way up the steep slick sides.

               The sound again.                                                     
                                                                                    
               Jack moves to the other cistern. Can definitely hear                 
               something inside...

               He throws off the metal lid. Swings his gun and flashlight           
               into the cistern.

               smeared, scared WOMAN. BLINKING up into his flashlight beam.         
               She shields her eyes with her right hand. Her left arm is            
               missing.  Jack's world crashes down around him; he can barely
