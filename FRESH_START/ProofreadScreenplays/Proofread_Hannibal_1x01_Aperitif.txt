**1. Episode:** Hannibal_1x01_Aperitif
   **Scene:** 2 EXT. HOME - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS - WILL’S P.O.V.
   **Error:** Formatting inconsistency - "POP WIDE - OMNISCIENT P.O.V." is not standard screenplay formatting. It reads more like a director's note.

   The shots are quick cuts in slow motion, showing entry and exit wounds, and plumes of terrycloth debris.

**11. Episode:** Hannibal_1x01_Aperitif
   **Scene:** 2 EXT. HOME - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS - WILL’S P.O.V.

               Will watches them for a long moment, taking in their                 
               domesticity, then walks with purpose for the front door.             
               OVERHEAD SHOT- OMNISCIENT P.O.V.                                     
                                                                                    
               The crowd of Officers, Detectives, Coroners and Specialists          
               parts to allow Will Graham a direct path.                            
                                                                                    
               ON WILL - WILL’S P.O.V.                                              
                                                                                    
               He marches to the front door and violently kicks it in. The          
               HOME SECURITY ALARM BLARES. Thomas Marlow rushes down the            
               stairs, two steps at a time, moving to intercept Will.               
                                                                                    
               Will raises a towel-wrapped arm. Thomas realizes too late            
               that it’s concealing a GUN. Will SHOOTS HIM TWICE THROUGH            
               THE NECK. 
               The shots are quick cuts in slow motion, showing entry and exit wounds, and plumes of terrycloth debris.
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         I shoot Mr. Marlow twice, severing                         
                         jugulars and carotids with near                            
                         surgical precision. This is what I do.                               
                                                                                    
               Theresa Marlow is frantically pushing the panic code into the        
               HOME SECURITY KEYPAD when Will SHOOTS HER expertly THROUGH          
               THE THROAT, missing her jugular, BREAKING HER NECK and               
               peppering the KEYPAD with blood. She drops to the floor.

                                   WILL GRAHAM (CONT’D)                             
                         I shoot Mrs. Marlow expertly                               
                         through the neck. It’s not a fatal wound. The bullet misses                             
                         every artery. But she can still feel it.                         
                         She’s helpless. This is what I do.                               
               Will finishes punching in “OFF” on the alarm code and the            
               blaring home security alarm falls silent. The              
               PHONE IMMEDIATELY RINGS. Will picks it up.                           
                                   VOICE ON TELEPHONE                               
                         Who is this?                                             
                                                                                    
               Will hangs up, then asks:

                         I need the Incident Report from the                        
                         Home Security company.                                     
                                                                                    
               Will is now holding the Incident Report.

                             (perusing the report)                                  
                         This was recorded as a false alarm.                        
                         There was a false alarm last week.                         
                             (then)                                                 
                         He tapped their phone.
