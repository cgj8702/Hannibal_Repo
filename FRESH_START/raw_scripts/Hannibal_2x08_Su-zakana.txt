               Hazy winter light shines through skeletal tree branches and          
               glints off snow. Highlights reflect off the water of a river         
               in the distance.                                                     
                                                                                    
               CRANE DOWN to find JACK CRAWFORD and WILL GRAHAM on the ice          
               of the frozen waterway. Ice fishing.                                 
               Will is unhooking a TROUT he has just caught. He deftly              
               unhooks it as Jack looks on. A BUCKET OF ICE lies on the ice         
               next to Will, filled with live trout.                                
                                                                                    
               Jack breathes frosty air and claps his gloved hands together.        
               Out of his element.

                         I get it. The great outdoors.  I                           
                         get the attraction. In the summer.

                         Trout are harder to catch when the                         
                         water is really cold.

                         That's another argument for summer.                        
                             (then)                                                 
                         Thought trout were hunters. They                           
                         should be chewing on my hook.

                         In the cold, their metabolisms                             
                         drop.  They're not as hungry.

                         That's the question. How do you                            
                         catch a fish who isn't hungry?

                         You have to change tactics. Use                            
                         live bait that moves and excites

                         a very Nietzsche-ian fish. Trials

                         was lying dead in her stall.                               
               In a stable, a DEAD HORSE lies on its side, stomach extended.

                         She had a foal two days ago?

                         It was born dead. She hasn't eaten                         
                         since, pining I guess.                                     
               The veterinarian bends to examine the dead horse.

                         Feels like she's still pregnant.                           
                         Did they check for twins?                                  
                                                                                    
               The stable hand shrugs, doesn't know. The veterinarian looks         
               unimpressed with the medical work.

                         Who performed this C-section?                              
                                   STABLE HAND                                      
                         She didn't have a C-section.                               
                                                                                    
               The veterinarian looks confused. Leans back so the stable hand       
               can see a rough line of stitches across the horse's belly.           
                                                                                    
                                   STABLE HAND (CONT’D)                             
                         Those weren't there yesterday.                             
                                                                                    
               For a moment, confusion clouds the veterinarian's face.              
               Then he makes a decision. Reaching into his medical bag, he          
               finds a SCALPEL and cuts the stitches loose.                         
                                                                                    
               He reaches through the thick wall of muscle with a gloved arm        
               and then pulls the innards free.                                     
                                                                                    
               As the horse's insides pour out onto the floor, entangled in         
               the guts and organs is the NUDE BODY OF A YOUNG WOMAN.

                         is divine. All beasts of burden

               He leans back and she rolls to him, leans against his chest,         
               looking him in the eye. Sips her wine.

                         was protecting you. The only way he                        
                         felt he had left to him.

                         him down” the wrong way. He’s

               Horses in the stable stalls. Nervousness communicating

               Walks backward from FRAME right across the stable in front of        
               the horses, their heads turning to follow him. Will holds a

               Looks down at the folder. It is open to a CRIME SCENE PHOTO          
               of the barn. The dead horse and Sarah Craber's body as seen          
               at the end of the Teaser.                                            
                                                                                    
               Will closes his eyes. The ORGANIC HUM of his CIRCULATORY SYSTEM      
               is loud in his ears. A PENDULUM swings across the blackness          
               behind his eyes. FWUM.  FWUM.  It clicks into place.                 
               WILL'S EYES OPEN. He now stands --

               He slides cloth hoods over the horses' heads. Strokes their          
               necks.  Murmurs gently. Calming them.

               Now Will is leading a horse from its stall. The dead horse-          
               to-be.  It too is hooded and stands calmly as Will strokes           
               its neck.  And then slides a large needle into its neck.             
               Will holds the horse's head lovingly.

                         Not to whoever did this.

                         Whoever did this knew the horse.                           
                         Knew she was dying because her foal                        
                         was born dead. Knew Sarah Craber.                          
                             (then)                                                 
                         He's familiar with the stables. He                         
                         knew when he wouldn't get caught.                          
                         He works here or maybe used to. He                         
                         has medical knowledge of animals,                          
                         but isn't a veterinarian. He                               
                         considers himself a healer.

                         How is this healing?

                         Sarah Craber was reborn. And a                             
                         mother and her child are finally on                        
                         the same side of life. This wasn't                         
                         murder, Jack. This was grief.                              
               OFF Jack considering their next move --

               Its head looking over a half door, breath frosting the air.          
                                                                                    
               Beyond it we see an FBI SUV coming down the track. We are --

               Two weathered buildings stand in a rustic setting, the animal        
               rescue and, beyond it, a LARGE-ANIMAL BARN where the black           
               horse looks out over its stall door.                                 
                                                                                    
               The SUV pulls up and stops. Jack and Will in the front seat.

               Will and Jack approach the doors and find them open. Share a         
               look and then Jack pulls the door aside and they enter. It           
               is dark inside, but full of low noises...

               NOISE.  On every wall, floor-to-ceiling metal cages contain

                         I didn't know her.                                         
                                                                                    
                                   JACK CRAWFORD                                    
                         Would you mind looking at a                                
                         photograph for me?                                         
                                                                                    
               Peter shakes his head, turns and murmurs to his animals.             
                                                                                    
                                   PETER BERNARDONE                                 
                         I know who she is, I just didn't                           
                         know her.                                                  
                                   JACK CRAWFORD                                    
                             (re: the picture)                                      
                         Just to be sure.                                           
                                                                                    
               Reluctantly, Peter takes it. Will is watching him closely.           
                                                                                    
               Taking a deep breath, Peter turns his line of sight away from        
               Jack.  Reaches for the photo. Looks at it closely, then              
               repeats the same pattern. Looks away from Jack. Then hands           
               him the photo. Under this, Jack and Will exchange looks.             
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         Peter, you had a head injury when                          
                         you worked at the stables.

                         I was kicked by a horse.                                   
                                                                                    
               Jack looks at Will.

                         It's an atypical motor response.                           
                         Peter's ability to look and touch                          
                         can only happen as separate events.                        
                             (to Peter)                                             
                         Aggravated by stress, isn't it?                            
               Peter glances at Will, exposed and somehow understood.

                         After everything that's happened,                          
                         Will, you still believe--

                         You can stop right there. You may                          
                         have to pretend, but I don't.                              
                                                                                    
               Hannibal stares at Will, smiles, then:

                         No, you don't. Not with me.

                         I don't expect you to admit                                
                         anything. You can't.  But I prefer                         
                         sins of omission to outright lies,                         
                         Dr. Lecter. Don't lie to me.

                         Will you return the courtesy? Why                          
                         have you resumed your therapy?

                         Can't just talk to any                                     
                         psychiatrist about what's kicking                          
                         round my head.                                             
               Hannibal gauges Will thoughtfully, then asks:

                         Do you fantasize about killing me?

                         Yes.

                         Tell me. How would you do it?                              
                                                                                    
               Will considers that a moment, then:                                  
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         With my hands.

                         apologies and forgiveness.

                         We've moved past a lot of things.                          
                         I discovered a truth about myself

                         I don't want to kill you anymore,                          
                         Dr. Lecter, not now that I finally                         
                         find you interesting.

                         I thought you were a killer.                               
                         Didn't want to hear anything else.                         
                         So wouldn't consider anything else.

                         If she thought we'd listen, maybe                          
                         she'd have come to us. She didn't.

               Hannibal is in session with Margot Verger.

                         My family doesn’t see me as the                            
                         victim.  They see me as the passive-                       
                         aggressor. They were disgusted by                          
                         what my brother did. Not with him.                         
                         With me for allowing it to happen.

                         Your brother dehumanized you and                           
                         your family unfortunately fosters                          
                         that climate of disrespect.

                         They think I’m weird.

                         I’m much weirder than you will ever                        
                         be, Margot. It’s fine to be weird.

                         They’ve already forgiven him. Talk                         
                         shows and self-help books thrive on                        
                         this sort of thing. Everybody                              
                         loves a sinner redeemed.

                         Anger is an energizing emotion;                            
                         prompts action against threat. If                          
                         you’re angry, you’re optimistic you                        
                         can stop this from happening again.

                         easy part. But to be angry with                            
                         the right person, and to the right                         
                         degree, and at the right time, and                         
                         for the right purpose, and in the                          
                         right way. That’s not easy.

               Will sits on one side of the examination table. Peter sits           
               on the other side. The bird is between them, acting as a             
               buffer as Will coaxes conversation out of Peter.

                         Said you're worried about the bird.                        
                         Thought you might like to see it.

                         Isn't this evidence?

                         I'm not FBI. I used to sort of be                          
                         FBI.  But now I'm really not.

                         What are you?

                         I'm figuring that out. You might                           
                         say this is some kind of therapy.

                         I've already got a social worker.

                         Therapy's not for you, it's for me.

                         The agent I was here with. He's                            
                         coming back with a warrant. He'll                          
                         arrest you, impound your animals.                          
                         And it will break your heart.

                         I didn't kill anybody.

                         I know you didn't, but that's not                          
                         always relevant. What did you do,                          
                         Peter?  They found Sarah Craber's                          
                         grave.  How did you find it?                               
               Peter's attention drifts from Will, focusing on the robin.

                         Funny how you can develop an                               
                         individual language with an animal                         
                         only you can understand. No one                            
                         else knows, not even other animals.

                         believed birds carried our souls                           
                         into the afterlife.

                         Sarah Craber? She's gone, she's                            
                         everywhere and nowhere.

                         Tell me who killed her.

                         wanted something beautiful for her.

                         You were grieving her. You                                 
                         couldn't save her, but you could                           
                         bring poetry to her death.

                         I wanted you to find me. If you                            
                         could find me, you could find him.

                         Do you have a shadow, Peter?                               
                         Someone only you can see. He's                             
                         someone you considered a friend.                           
                         He made you feel you weren't alone.                        
                         Until you saw what he really is,                           
                         and it made you even lonelier.

               He pulls his hand away. His face changes, eyes become still          
               and cold.  Then he smiles again, forcing charm back through.

               Oddly quiet and still. Dark inside, but the low noises we've         
               heard before are absent. Peter walks inside and senses               
               something is wrong. Turns on a light to find --                      
               THE WALLS OF CAGES                                                   
                                                                                    
               Are all empty. Their doors thrown open. The food and                 
               bedding tossed haphazardly about.                                    
                                                                                    
               Peter moans deep within himself. Turns and exits --

               Peter comes out running and heads for the large-animal barn.         
               He rushes inside.

               The horse lies dead on the floor amidst the pens and stalls.         
               Bleeding out from a head wound, next to a bloody hammer.             
               Peter drops to his knees and strokes the horse's head. A             
               shadow falls across him and he turns to see Clark Ingram             
               standing behind him. Incongruously, Ingram holds a bloodied          
               hammer, a tuft of black horse hair stuck to the blood.

                         worried about you. You've been                             
                         expressing a lot of rage recently.                         
               Peter stares at him as if he were mad, tears welling.

                         So often in my line of work, I see                         
                         people take out their resentments                          
                         on those closest to them. It's a                           
                         sad fact of human nature. And your                         
                         brain injury leaves you prone to                           
                         extremes of emotion. The way you

               Peter is realizing how realistic this version of events              
               sounds.  Shakes his head. Agitated.  Hating the kernel of            
               truth behind these lies.

                         Sarah was a sad reminder of all the                        
                         things you'll never have.

                         And that's the very horse who                              
                         kicked you in the head.                                    
               Peter looks at the horse.

                         Some will say this was a long-time                         
                         coming.  I know I will. Already                            
                         have.  Sixteen women, Peter. You                           
                         killed the first shortly after your                        
                         accident. You killed them because                          
                         you weren't worthy of them.                                
               Clark sounds so plausible. He smiles at Peter, suddenly his          
               eyes are so cruel.

                         raising their chicks. But a robin

                         human.  We just don't understand

               face to the steel of the hammer still clotted with gore...           
               He bends and picks it up.

               Clark stands still, momentarily thrown by this polite greeting.

               Hannibal turns his head and Will Graham steps out of darkness,       
               coming INTO FOCUS as he enters the barn, gun raised before him.      
                                                                                    
               Hannibal steps to one side. Watching, fascinated.                    
               Will approaches Ingram.                                              
                                                                                    
               As Will approaches with the gun, Ingram sees murder in his           
               eyes and drops the hammer.

               Clark holds out his arms and drops to his knees like a               
               penitent.  Smiles up at the advancing Will.
