               Shafts of beautiful winter moonlight.                                
                                                                                    
               WILL GRAHAM                                                          
                                                                                    
               Stands in the woods. In hunting gear. A rifle under his              
               arm.  Will moves through the forest, stepping carefully, gun         
               raised at port arms. Listening.  The woodland symphony.              
                                                                                    
               He sees movement in the trees up ahead. Raises his rifle to          
               his shoulder. SLOWLY the BLACK STAG moves into view.                 
               Fearsome and majestic. It TURNS and looks right at Will.             
               Will is FROZEN. Then his finger tightens on the trigger.             
                                                                                    
               But the BLACK STAG is gone. There’s a rustling in the trees          
               behind him. Will spins around, rifle at the ready.                   
                                                                                    
               He catches a glimpse of the BLACK STAG moving. Will follows          
               it with his gun, then loses sight. He listens with the barrel        
               of his rifle. More rustling to his right. Then to his left.          
                                                                                    
               Then silence.                                                        
               Will slowly advances deeper into the forest, moving                  
               cautiously. He approaches a thicket of branches, and the             
               BLACK STAG BOLTS. Will FIRES.  The STAG RUNS.                        
                                                                                    
               Will arrives where the STAG was, finds blood on leaves. It           
               SMEARS across his fingers.                                           
                                                                                    
               Will follows the spots of blood. As he pursues, faster, more         
               urgent.  Will breathes hard, breath FROSTING.                        
                                                                                    
               He sees a patch of blood, slick and BLACK in the moonlight.          
               He stops as the BLACK STAG comes into view ahead, between the        
               trees.  He raises the rifle but it is there and then gone.           
                                                                                    
               Will runs to the spot.

               Sees the STAG. Raises his rifle.

               The BLACK STAG judders and crashes through undergrowth. Will         
               after it.  It disappears into a dense THICKET.                       
                                                                                    
               CRASHING from within. As if the STAG has collapsed.                  
                                                                                    
               Will, hoarse and panting, pushes into the THICKET. Tense.            
               Nervous.                                                             
                                                                                    
               A glimpse of ANTLERS, moving, low to the ground -- through           
               the brush.                                                           
                                                                                    
               Will parts the BRANCHES with his rifle barrel. To SEE --             
               ABIGAIL HOBBS                                                        
                                                                                    
               She stares up at him. Abigail’s eyes fix on Will in a silent         
               plea.  She looks exactly as she did when he first saw her in         
               her family’s kitchen, but instead of a slit throat, there is         
               a bullet hole in her neck that is gushing blood in spurts,           
               instead of lying on a kitchen floor, she is in mud and snow.         
                                                                                    
               Will stares in fixed horror.                                         
                                                                                    
               CAMERA REVEALS A FIGURE near Will; it is black, melding into         
               the shadows, almost human but with an ANTLERED head.                 
               Suddenly, shockingly, this MAN STAG is nearly upon Will,             
               fixing him with a terrifying gaze --

               Wakes up with a jerk. WE ARE --

               Will is in his bed, dawn light streaking through the windows.        
               He looks drawn, ill, groggy.                                         
                                                                                    
               The dogs are barking and he throws back the covers. To

               A beautiful winter morning. Will shields his eyes on the             
               porch as the dogs rush out barking. WINSTON stays by Will’s          
               side.  He looks down at him.                                         
               Winston pushes his head under his hand. The others bark and          
               mill.  Something has them thrown, agitated.

               The dogs fuss around Will as he heads for the SINK, and runs         
               the tap good and cold. He drinks from the faucet.

               AND THEN, with sudden violence, he RETCHES and HURLS into the

                         that I killed her. But it wasn’t

               In t-shirt and boxers, WILL GRAHAM stands in the brightly-           
               lit, sterile space on a white paper mat. Staring straight            
               ahead.  He hands his pants to Jimmy Price who bags them. His         
               shirt and his right and left shoes are stacked on a nearby           
               table in three separate, appropriately labelled evidence             
               bags.  His eyeglasses and watch are also bagged and tagged.          
               Jimmy Price holds Will’s khakis with one gloved-hand and digs        
               through the pockets with another. Zeller logs the evidence           
               next to an operational video camera.                                 
                                                                                    
               It is painfully awkward for them all. Will stares in silence.

               He handles the small folded knife carefully, examining the           
               knife handle, a smudged fingerprint in what might be blood.

               She pushes them back. Finally she can’t hear another word.

                         Just stop talking.                                         
                                                                                    
               It comes out more of as a plea as opposed to anything                
               hostile.  A long beat of silence, both of them stressed,             
               neither of them above succumbing to the pressure of it.

                         “He won’t. Get too close.”  You                            
                         said you would cover him. You                              
                         could see he was breaking.

                         Yes, I could. And I kept pushing                           
                         him because he was saving lives.

                         Not Abigail Hobbs’ life.

                         Look me in the eye and tell me you                         
                         couldn’t see he was breaking.

                         Of course I could see it.  I told                          
                         you not to put him out there.

                         Every decision I made about Will                           
                         Graham’s mental health was under                           
                         the advisement of a respected                              
                         psychiatrist, who you recommended.

                         Hannibal had to know. He had to                            
                         see something was wrong.

                         Not until it was too late. Just                            
                         like the rest of us.                                       
                             (then)                                                 
                         Hannibal said Will was exhibiting                          
                         signs of dementia.

                         Dementia isn’t a disease, it’s a                           
                         symptom of disease. We have to find                        
                         out what’s causing it and treat it.

                         The concern is that there may not                          
                         be anything to treat. Will had a                           
                         brain scan. They found nothing.

                         This started with Garret Jacob Hobbs.

                         Maybe Will did what Garret Jacob                           
                         Hobbs couldn’t do. Kill his daughter.

                         Abigail’s blood is on all of us.

                         And so is Will’s.

               she lets out her frustration and anger and sadness.

               She can’t hide her distress at seeing him this way. And he           
               can’t hide his relief at seeing her walk through the door.

                         I could use a good scream. I can

                         I’m afraid if I started, I...

               We are TRACKING along the dark, empty hallway towards where          
               light shines through from a window by the door.

               They flash their flashlights, SCANNING the room. And the

               corridor.

               He sits alone.                                                       
                                                                                    
               A MUFFLED CLICKING SOUND can be heard. Faint, but getting            
               LOUDER.  Will looks to the TWO WAY MIRROR. The MUFFLED HOOF          
               STEPS draw closer and closer. Will stands from the table and         
               crosses to the MIRROR, cupping his hands to see through it.          
                                                                                    
               Nothing.  Just the dark reflection of his eyes. Then a               
               SILHOUETTE rises from the darkness behind the mirror, as if          
               made from it. The ANTLERED MAN, Will’s personal Devil.               
                                                                                    
               As Will shudders with horror...

               Will is sitting back at the table, staring absently at the           
               TWO WAY MIRROR. He realizes not only did he not get up and           
               cross to the mirror because of his shackles, but now...

               A tiny startle from Will. He was off in a nightmare when             
               Jack walked into the room and sat opposite him.

               Will is watching the solitary GUARD opposite him. He glances         
               away with trepidation, he knows what he has to do, but               
               doesn’t want to do it. He steels himself.                            
                                                                                    
               Will looks down, takes a deep breath and CRACKS his thumbs           
               out of joint. A horrible SHRIEK/GROAN of pain as he slides           
               his broken hand from the cuff in one move.

                         we went to interview Garret Jacob

                         while I was outside loading the car                        
                         with files, but he was only in

                         It’s how Will said he caught Hobbs.                        
                         How would you say he caught Hobbs?

                         Everyone.                                                  
                                                                                    
               The final dog sits. Alana allows herself a small, sad smile          
               as she unfastens each of their collars from the lead.

                         Okay.                                                      
               She gives them each a small treat. Alana shrugs off her coat         
               and drops her bag on the counter as the pack of dogs mill.           
               She crosses to the REFRIGERATOR.                                     
                                                                                    
               Alana grabs a beer and pops the cap. The dogs follow her.            
               She takes a deep sip and sighs. She rests the cold bottle            
               against her forehead. She’s exhausted.                               
                                                                                    
               Just as she’s noticed the dogs have all trailed away...

               Alana STARTLES, dropping her bottle of beer. CAMERA REVEALS          
               Will Graham is now standing in the room with her, the dogs           
               milling about, sniffing and greeting him with wagging tails.

                         through the door?

                         No, they wouldn’t. Because they                            
                         know I could kill you before they                          
                         got up those stairs.                                       
               The reality of that hangs in the air, then:

               He quietly moves toward the back door, disappearing down the         
               hall.  Alana waits there a moment, afraid to move. She               
               realizes she stopped breathing and takes a jagged breath.

                         Would Dr. Lecter put himself in                            
                         danger to help Will?

                         We’re not suspecting Hannibal of                           
                         doing anything criminal.

               briefly before averting his eyes and turning away.

               Will shrinks into the shadows of the house. Hannibal follows.

               Steps into the room. He bows his head, his face crumpled             
               with emotion. He takes a breath and then looks up again.

                         die in this kitchen. Nothing we

               though he is seeing it for the first time. Will looks at the         
               ARTERIAL SPRAY on the wall, deeply saddened.

                         You called here that morning.                              
                         Abigail knew. You kept her secrets                         
                         until she found out some of yours.                         
                                                                                    
               Hannibal eyes the gun in Will’s hand.

                         Garret Jacob Hobbs, Will. Would it                         
                         feel good to kill me now?

                         Garret Jacob Hobbs was a murderer.                         
                         Are you a murderer, Dr. Lecter?

                         You have no traceable motive, which                        
                         is why you were so hard to see.                            
                         You were just curious what I would                         
                         do.  Someone like me. Someone who                          
                         thinks how I think. Wind him up                            
                         and watch him go. Apparently, Dr.                          
                         Lecter, this is how I go.                                  
               Betrayed and confused, Will’s finger tenses on the trigger.

               Jack Crawford ENTERS, gun drawn, sees Will is preparing to           
               shoot Hannibal, and in a terrible re-enactment, SHOOTS WILL.

               A bullet slams into Will’s shoulder and he is knocked against        
               the counter, slides down it. Right where Garret Jacob Hobbs          
               died. Blood flecks Hannibal’s face and shirt.                        
                                                                                    
               Jack comes forward, still holding his smoking weapon. He             
               kicks the gun from Will’s loose fingers. Looks down at the           
               bleeding Will with anguish.                                          
                                                                                    
               Will looks up at Jack and Hannibal. Will holds Jack’s gaze.

               The gurney is being moved to an ambulance by PARAMEDICS.             
               (Just as Abigail was rushed to hospital in Episode 101.)

               As an ER team work on Will, his clothes have been pulled             
               away.  A DOCTOR is cleaning the BULLET WOUND in his shoulder.        
               The wound is ugly and red.
