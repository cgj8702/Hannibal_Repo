               It's filled with warm water and Epsom salts. Will's bloody,          
               bruised hands are submerged, tinging the water pink.

               They sit at one end of the dining room table, Randall Tier's         
               body still splayed across it. Hannibal removes Will's hands          
               from the Epsom salts bath, drying them. Will stares absently         
               as Hannibal treats his wounds. Hannibal clocks the retreat.

               Hannibal applies salve to the cuts and bruises on Will's             
               hands, gently rubbing the ointment into his open wounds.

                         you.  This is pride.

                         who you are. What you feel finally

               Margot unbridles the horse, puts on its halter and removes           
               its saddle. She brushes the horse, stroking it as she

               He smiles a dazzling smile. He is good-looking, wears his            
               wealth and power easily. He holds a SUCKLING PIG in his arms

               Margot sighs, hands her horse's reins to a VALET.

               The valet walks the horse to its stall and secures it.

               Mason leads Margot through wooden doors and into a church-

                         After Papa died, I had a Christmas                         
                         epiphany. I've seen exotic pigs                            
                         from all over the world. What                              
                         would happen if I brought together                         
                         the best of all I had seen.                                
                                                                                    
               He's excited. CAMERA reveals a large square metal structure,         
               slatted -- with an open central area. A MAZE.

                         You built a maze. Shudder to think.                        
               CARLO DEOGRACIAS works at a table to one side of the                 
               platform.  Stag's tooth flicking in and out of his mouth. We         
               see his work: He is stuffing ground meat, chickens and               
               vegetables into the legs of an EFFIGY. A smart suit tied at          
               the wrists and bulging with food. A meatloaf for a head.

                         I feel like Stradivarius                                   
                         approaching his worktable. Our                             
                         father was a pioneer of livestock                          
                         production. I think he'd have been                         
                         proud of all my efforts.                                   
               Carlo finishes stuffing the effigy and ties off the last leg         
               with string. Incongruously, he squirts the effigy with scent         
               from a bottle of perfume.

                         A pig is not like other animals.                           
                         There is a spark of intelligence and                       
                         a terrible practicality in pigs.                           
                                                                                    
               Mason nods at Carlo who hoists the effigy in his arms and            
               walks past them, onto the roof of the maze, and attaches the         
               effigy to an overhead hook.

                         Your mouth gets rough when you're                          
                         scared, Margot. Tough as a livery                          
                         pony who is resentful of the bit.                          
                                                                                    
               Carlo is now using a winch to lower the effigy. Upright, it          
               resembles a man much more. Meat oozing round the bindings.           
               Carlo pulls a lever and there is a sudden rush of feet, and          
               something huge enters the maze. Through the slats we can see         
               glimpses of a herd of terrible SWINE. They SQUEAL in                 
               excitement and hurry toward the center.

                         The structure is designed to excite                        
                         and antagonize the pigs.                                   
                                                                                    
               Margot looks horrified.

                         clothes with meat, scent it with                           
                         human smells. Play screams every                           
                         time they're fed. Come the real                            
                         thing, we won't need the recording.                        
                                                                                    
               Mason presses a button and Margot starts as the sound of             
               SCREAMS plays on hidden speakers. Mason beams at her.                
               Mason nods to Carlo and he starts lowering the meat-headed           
               effigy toward the clamoring pigs.

                         It's not just about making Papa                            
                         proud.  It's about us. It's about                          
                         family.  I want you to be proud of                         
                         me too, Margot. You're all I have.                         
                             (then)                                                 
                         And I'm all you have.                                      
                                                                                    
               The effigy starts shaking as its lower half is torn apart.           
               Margot is managing her horror. Mason grins at her:

                         Margot.  You've known it for years.

                         Mason hired a stocky, florid man in                        
                         an alpine hat. I'm told a leading

                         Dr. Chilton killed Abigail Hobbs?

                         in the face. He's not exactly in

               shirt, revealing the raw, red gouges from Randall Tier's             
               claws.  Her hand moves across his chest to the jagged button         
               scar where Jack Crawford shot him.

               Will lies back into bed, Margot on top of him amidst the

               kiss her passionately. Her arms circling his shoulders,              
               drawing him closer to her.

               As Hannibal pulls back OUT OF FRAME, we follow his movement,         
               but it is now WILL that we see, darkness of the room behind          
               him.  Beneath him, Alana; they kiss passionately, rolling            
               onto their sides. Will opens one eye, looking beyond Alana           
               to Hannibal watching him intently as he makes love to her.           
                                                                                    
               Alana turns away from Will and embraces Hannibal in a kiss,          
               as if they were all three in the same bed together. Alana            
               turns from Hannibal, back to Will, rolling on top of him.

               She arches her back in climax and then collapses on Will,            
               heaving with satisfied exhaustion. She rolls onto her back.

               Alana leans INTO FRAME from the left and kisses him. Turns

               Will lies on his side, the other side empty. He is watching          
               silently as Margot quietly dresses, lit by shadow and

                         What matters to you, Margot? After                         
                         you fought your brother so long.

                         You may not believe this, but it's                         
                         not just the money. Well, it is a                          
                         little bit, but I do want a child.

                         patients die while under his care.

               Freddie stands on Will's veranda, peers through the door.            
               Can see THE DOGS, but no Will Graham.                                
                                                                                    
               She KNOCKS again. She tries the door, pushes. It doesn't             
               open.  Freddie moves off the veranda, peers through windows.         
               Looks under the house. An opportunity she may not get again.

               Freddie Lounds now stands in front of the large doors. A

               Light floods in as the doors open and Freddie Lounds steps           
               in, silhouetted against the light behind.                            
                                                                                    
               She moves into the shed, bag over her shoulder. Old                  
               carpentry wood, a stack of firewood logs, boxes of ancient           
               fishing tackle. Ancient machinery.  And RANDALL TIER'S               
               MAULING SUIT. It hangs like a skinned animal from a beam.            
                                                                                    
               Without thinking, Freddie absently pulls out her camera and          
               takes a few pictures. In the BURST OF LIGHT from her flash,          
               Freddie notices something. She studies the bones closer.             
               The bear skull glowering at her, the claws hang on either            
               side, bloody and stained. She glances around the room and            
               continues taking pictures of every detail of the space.

               SHAPED PAPER-WRAPPED FISH catches Freddie's eye. Unlike the          
               other fish, it's in a plastic bag.                                   
                                                                                    
               Freddie opens the bag and retrieves the horseshoe-wrapped

                         I don't want to hear it.                                   
                                                                                    
               Will takes a menacing step closer.

                         You're not the least bit curious?                          
                                   FREDDIE LOUNDS                                   
                         Get away from the door.

                         I can't let you go, Freddie. Not                           
                         without hearing what I have to say.                        
                             (takes another step)                                   
                         I know you're scared. Only have to                         
                         be scared just a little bit longer.                        
                             (raises his hand)                                      
                         Give me the gun.                                           
               He takes a final step and Freddie FIRES. BANG. The bullet            
               raises SPLINTERS off the wall, narrowly missing Will.                
                                                                                    
               Will CHARGES, violently slamming into Freddie.                       
                                                                                    
               BANG-BANG-BANG, Freddie keeps firing until Will wrenches the         
               gun from her hand. She chops her foot hard down his instep           
               and scrambles away. Will bolts after her, slamming into the          
               wall as he slips on the cold floor.                                  
                                                                                    
               Freddie is nearly to the door as Will grabs her by the back          
               of the head, snatching a fistful of red hair.                        
               Freddie's hand comes from her bag with PEPPER SPRAY. She blasts      
               Will with it. Will lets go of her, hands to his eyes...

               smells it. Hannibal looks up at Will with a smile. Because

                         Apart from humane considerations,                          
                         it's more flavorful for animals to                         
                         be stress-free prior to slaughter.                         
                         This animal tastes frightened.

                         What does "frightened" taste like?

                         It's acidic.

                         The meat is bitter about being dead.                       
               Hannibal is amused by that notion.

                         This meat isn't pork.

                         It's long pig.                                             
                                                                                    
               Will takes a bite. Hannibal watches him intently, proud.

                         You can't reduce me to a set of                            
                         influences. I'm not the product of                         
                         anything. I've given up good and                           
                         evil for behaviorism.

                         Then you can't say that I'm evil.

                         You're destructive. Same thing.

                         Evil's just destructive? Storms                            
                         are evil, if it's that simple. And                         
                         we have fire, and then there's                             
                         hail.  Underwriters lump it all                            
                         under "Acts of God."

                         Is this meal an act of God, Will?                          
               Hannibal takes a final bite and we...
