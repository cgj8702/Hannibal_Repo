               Gunshots in the stalls around him ring in his ears, but he's         
               focused on his target -- gazing uncomfortably at it. He              
               pulls off his safety glasses, setting his pistol down and            
               trying and failing to measure his breath.                            
               REVERSING, we see what's got him so worked up:                       
                                                                                    
               A dead-eyed GARRET JACOB HOBBS at the end of the alley. He           
               appears to glide toward Will menacingly...

               He fumbles for his pistol, re-loading with shaking hands             
               before he FIRES. BLAM-BLAM-BLAM the bullets rip through              
               Hobbs like paper, leaving clean holes and no blood.                  
               Garrett Jacob Hobbs doesn't stop, continuing to advance even         
               as Will fires a barrage of bullets: BLAM-BLAM-BLAM-BLAM...

               of antler under a veil-like evidence bag. Will focuses on the        
               bloody stag rack, cutting through the bag to look closer.            
               He turns, examining the rest of the room. Will looks around

               CAMERA FOLLOWS WILL GRAHAM down the corridor toward his              
               lecture hall. He peers through the window of his classroom.

               Pushing his glasses up, Will takes a breath and steps into --

               --where, to his surprise, he's greeted with a standing               
               ovation from his students. The clapping stops him cold. Will         
               waves them off, uncomfortable.

                         Thank you. Please stop that.                               
                                                                                    
               The applause peters out. Will dumps his briefcase on the             
               desk and dives right into the lecture. He dims the lights,           
               bringing up a slide of Hobbs’s resignation letter.

                         This is how I caught Garret Jacob                          
                         Hobbs.  It's his resignation                               
                         letter.  Anybody see the clue?                             
               A few hands go into the air. Will ignores them.

                         There isn’t one. He wrote a                                
                         letter, left his phone number...                           
                         but no address. That’s it.                                 
                                                                                    
               CLICK. Will advances to the next slide and we POP CLOSE on           
               the crime scene photo of the Hobbs kitchen -- dead Hobbs,            
               blood everywhere. It’s horrific.

                         Bad bookkeeping and dumb luck.                             
               We POP CLOSE on the picture -- and Will suddenly walks into

               Abigail Hobbs on the floor, her struggle to breathe                  
               underscored by the WHEEZE of air through her slashed wind-           
               pipe. Will applies pressure to the wounds, cradling her head

                         Reason you currently "used to" work                        
                         homicide is you couldn't stomach                           
                         pulling the trigger. You just                              
                         pulled the trigger ten times.

               pulls the HIGH-POWERED MICROPHONE away from the wall, winding        
               EAR BUDS around her fist then stuffing them in her pocket.

                         I've never seen a psychiatrist                             
                         before and I'm unfortunately                               
                         thorough. So you're one of three                           
                         doctors I'm interviewing. It's                             
                         more or less a bake-off.

                         I'm very supportive of bake-offs.                          
                         It's important you find someone                            
                         you're comfortable with.

                         I can imagine you as my therapist,                         
                         which is good. If I couldn't                               
                         visualize opening up emotionally, I                        
                         know it would be a problem.

                         May I ask why now?

                         Would it be alright if I asked you                         
                         a few questions first?

                         I love that you've written so much                         
                         on social exclusion. Since that's                          
                         why I'm here, I was wondering --

                         Are you Freddie Lounds?                                    
               It's as though he snatched the air right out of her throat.

                         I am so embarrassed.

               As before. Hannibal studies her, then pats the cushion of            
               the seat next to him, beckoning her like a child or a pet.

               Freddie eyes Hannibal, not sure if she should bolt or do             
               exactly what he tells her to do. She chooses the latter.             
               Hannibal's arm is propped casually on the back of the seat,          
               within snatching distance of Freddie's neck.

               Freddie, rattled under Hannibal's penetrative gaze, pulls her        
               phone out of her purse, stops it recording.

               She deletes the file and hands her SMART PHONE to Hannibal.          
               He examines it, satisfied the recordings were deleted.

               WIDE ANGLE REVEALING a calm, ordinary Big Box Pharmacy.              
               Despite the vehicles in the parking lot, the storefront is           
               strangely quiet, deserted. After a moment, there's a small           
               flurry of movement... armed, dark-clad figures creeping in           
               swiftly and silently, moving along the outside of the                
               building, weaving through parked cars, taking up positions.

               Will is sound asleep in his chair, feet propped up on an

               FAINT, EERIE WHISPER beneath the silence, barely audible.

               floor as he reached for it. Will pulls Abigail's gurney into         
               the hall, moving in on Eldon, kicking his gun out of reach.          
               Will looks down at Eldon, who is in a state of shock.

                         where she could finally reach back.

                         was your paddle with Hobbs?

                         I am.  It wasn't the act of killing                        
                         Hobbs that got you down, was it?                           
                         Did you really feel so bad because                         
                         killing him felt so good?
