                         someone one way or another. Be it                          
                         your own hands or the hand of God.                         
                         Now think about killing Mrs. Marlow.                       
               A SERIES OF MARLOWE HOME CRIME SCENE PICTURES are projected          
               on the screen behind Will.

               He surveys the lecture hall for social appearances. The              
               Trainees’ eyes are always OUT OF FRAME, at most we glimpse           
               brows, lids, the occasional lash -- but never eye contact.

                         Why did she deserve this? Tell me                          
                         your design. Tell me who you are.

               He walks down the corridor toward Will Graham’s lecture hall.

               JACK CRAWFORD (weathered, austere, strongly built late 40s)          
               ENTERS as the TRAINEES file out of the classroom. There are          
               scattered SMITTEN GLANCES tossed Will Graham’s direction, who        
               is naturally oblivious because he is actively avoiding eye-          
               contact with everyone, even as he warns his exiting students:

                         The sad, dull truth of these crimes                        
                         is they can usually be reduced to a                        
                         male penetrative control issue. I am                       
                         expecting a higher level of scrutiny.                      
                                                                                    
               The last of the TRAINEES EXITS and Will notices he’s alone in

               Will quickly puts on a pair of glasses as Jack approaches.

               Jack knows full well they’ve met but didn’t intend to broach.

                         Yes, we had a disagreement about                           
                         the museum when we opened it.

                         I disagreed with what you named it.

                         It’s a little hammy, Jack.                                 
                                                                                    
               Jack likes Will’s directness and returns the favor:

                         You’ve hitched your horse to a                             
                         teaching post. I understand it’s                           
                         not easy for you to be sociable.

                         I’m just talking at them. I’m not                          
                         listening to them. It’s not social.                        
               Jack gently pushes Will’s glasses up the bridge of his nose          
               so he’s forced to make fleeting eye contact.

                         Where do you fall on the spectrum?                         
                                                                                    
               Will picks up the rhythm and syntax of Jack’s voice:

                         My horse is hitched to a post                              
                         closer to Aspergers and Autistics                          
                         than narcissists and sociopaths.

                         I can empathize with anybody. Less                         
                         to do with personality disorders                           
                         than an active imagination.

                         He would hide how special she is.                          
                         I mean, I would. Wouldn’t you?

                         That’s not really true, is it? You                         
                         have a specific way of thinking.

                         The evidence explains.

                         Then help me find some evidence.                           
               Will studies the beautiful milquetoast faces on the map.

               Elise’s PARENTS. They are sick with worry. Mr. Nichols is            
               rationalizing while Mrs. Nichols seems almost resigned.

                         She could have gone off by herself.                        
                         She was a very interior young                              
                         woman.  She didn’t like living in a                        
                         dorm.  I could see how the pressure                        
                         of school might have gotten to her.                        
                         She likes trains. Maybe she just                           
                         got on a train and...                                      
               Will Graham and Jack Crawford sit opposite Mr. and Mrs.

                         What?

                         How’s your cat? Elise was supposed                         
                         to feed it. Was the cat weird when                         
                         you came home? It didn’t eat all                           
                         weekend. Must have been hungry.                            
               The Nichols are initially unsure how to respond, then:

                         I didn’t notice.

                         He took her from here.

                         She got on a train. She came home.                         
                         She fed the cat. And he took her.

               The Nichols are trying to wrap their minds around the quick          
               flurry of action and what it means to their little girl.

                         Police were up there this morning.

               Mr. Nichols leads Will, who pulls on gloves as they approach.        
               Will warily eyes the CAT pawing at the door eager to go              
               inside.  Will stops Mr. Nichols from reaching the door knob.

                         I’ll get that. Mr. Nichols, would                          
                         you put your hands in your pockets                         
                         and avoid touching anything please?

                         You can hold the cat if it’s easier.                       
                                                                                    
               Mr. Nichols picks up the cat as instructed. Will wraps a             
               gloved hand around the knob and opens the door.

               The light from the hallway streaks across the floor and up           
               the wall as Will ENTERS. He stands just inside the door,             
               immediately noticing the OPEN WINDOW. He flicks on the light         
               switch, illuminating the room. He stares.                            
               ELISE NICHOLS                                                        
                                                                                    
               She lays coffin-style in her bed, dressed in pajamas as if           
               she had JUST gone to sleep. The gray pallor of her skin, the         
               clean PUNCTURE WOUNDS visible under her pajamas, and her un-         
               breathing bosom are immediately evident to Will. Sadly, Mr.          
               Nichols fails to notice. Blinded by hope, he steps forward.

               Will Graham has climbed out the window onto the porch roof.          
               He sits on the gritty shingles. He hugs his knees, his damp          
               shirt pressed cold across his back. He snorts the night air          
               to cleanse the smell of Elise Nichols death from his nose.           
               From his vantage point, he can see POLICE OFFICERS, POLICE           
               CARS and other CRIME SCENE SPECIALISTS assembled on the lawn.        
               Mr. and Mrs. Nichols are treated in the back of an Ambulance.        
                                                                                    
               Will Graham takes a breath, exhales, then closes his eyes.

               It swings in the darkness of Will Graham’s mind, keeping             
               rhythm with his heart beat. FWUM.  FWUM. FWUM.

               He OPENS HIS EYES and he is standing outside Elise Nichols’          
               Bedroom Window. The neighborhood is quiet and empty. No              
               Police.  No Police Cars. No Ambulance.                               
                                                                                    
               He looks through the window glass to Elise Nichols sleeping          
               soundly in her bed. Will quietly opens the window.

               Will stands over Elise Nichols, very much alive. He watches          
               her for a quiet moment. Tears well in Will’s eyes, then...           
               Will bears down on Elise’s chest with his knee, cracking ribs        
               as he simultaneously squeezes her throat shut with his hands.        
               It’s sudden and horrible and violent. Elise is immediately           
               startled out of a deep sleep into terror.                            
                                                                                    
               Elise struggles, her face swelling with pressure, capillaries        
               in her skin and the whites of her eye WRINKLE and BURST.             
               Tears stream down her cheeks as she tries to scream but              
               cannot.  The bed board finally SNAPS and with it, Elise dies.

               Will stares into middle distance as he drives, hypnotized by         
               the pavement unfurling ahead of him. HEADLIGHTS reflect off

               collar, matted fur, nevertheless it trots with determination,        
               barely acknowledging Will as he rolls down his window.

               slows to a stop and gets out of his car, at which point the          
               dog abruptly turns around and heads the opposite direction.

               physically, Will gets back in his car and u-turns on the road        
               to pursue the dog who is keeping a steady pace trotting away.

               An ALPHA DOG steps forward and growls at Winston. Will

               Alpha steps back into line, sits, then lays down obediently.

               Will lets the hot water wash over him, surrounded by steam.          
               The steam GROWS MORE DENSE and then slowly and only slightly,        
               THINS REVEALING Will is now STANDING IN THE MISTY FOREST OF          
               THIS MIND. He is deep in thought, barely noticing the STAG           
               walking through the misty forest fog only 20 feet away.              
               SNAPPING BACK TO THE SHOWER, Will shuts off the water.

               The entire pack is huddled together sleigh-dog style                 
               surrounding Winston’s dog kennel. Will sleeps quietly in his         
               bed on the other side of the room. Moonlight-cast tree               
               branch shadows stretch along the walls and across the                
               ceiling.  Then there’s another breathing in the room.                
                                                                                    
               Will calmly opens his eyes, holding his own breath as he             
               listens for the second breather. The mysterious breathing            
               continues as Will turns to see laying in bed next to him:            
                                                                                    
               ELISE NICHOLS                                                        
                                                                                    
               She’s wearing the nightie Will found her in, appearing               
               exactly as she did in her own bed, but now she’s in his.             
               As Will reaches out to touch her, the ANTLER-LIKE TREE BRANCH        
               SHADOWS shift and stretch, piercing Elise through her wounds,        
               re-impaling her and pulling her into the DARKNESS.                   
                                                                                    
               Elise slowly recedes into the SHADOWS and disappears.

               He jolts awake in his bed, soaking wet with perspiration.            
               Elise Nichols was lying next to him only in a dream.

               His shirt and underwear cling indiscriminately as he throws          
               back the damp sheets and climbs out of bed. He EXITS peeling         
               off clothes like a wet bathing suit that then slaps to the           
               floor.                                                               
               Will ENTERS, pulling on a dry t-shirt and underwear, lays a

He’s not shallow.

                         You could tell something about him                         
                         or you wouldn’t’ve said this was an                        
                         apology. What’s he apologizing for?

                         Couldn’t honor her. He feels bad.

                         Feeling bad defeats the purpose of                         
                         being a psychopath, doesn’t it?

                         Yes.  It does.

                         Then what kind of crazy is he?

                         He couldn’t show her he loved her                          
                         so he put her corpse back where he                         
                         killed it. Whatever crazy that is.

                         You think he loves these girls?

                         He loves one of them, and I think                          
                         by association, he has some form of                        
                         love for the others.

                         There was no semen or saliva.                              
                         Elise Nichols died a virgin and                            
                         that corpse kept her promise.

                         That’s not how he’s loving them.                           
                         He wouldn’t disrespect them that                           
                         way.  He doesn’t want these girls                          
                         to suffer. He kills them quickly                           
                         and, to his thinking, with mercy.

               A small, enclosed work space in a sealed, clean room.

               She has Elise Nichols’ NIGHTIE suspended from a hanger over a        
               table covered with white paper. Working under bright lights          
               in the draft-free room, she brushes the nightie with a metal         
               spatula, working with the wale and across it, with the nap           
               and against it. Something falls through the still air:

               It falls to the paper. Beverly studies it with bright eyes:

               It’s secured in a vise positioned against the PIPE CUTTER’S          
               JAWS.  The cutter’s knurled handle turns as a small amount of        
               CUTTING OIL is applied to the blade, seeping over it.

               The cutter is rotated and the blade is tightened, cutting            
               into the pipe, shaving curls of metal as THREADS are carved.

               It falls in similar fashion as it did in the crime lab.              
               Instead of white paper, it lands on a pile of metal shavings.

               the same hair color, eye color, weight and height as Elise           
               Nichols and the seven young women before her.

               Hannibal eyes his credentials, then dismisses Franklyn.

               Jack Crawford cools his heels, idly picks up a magazine. The         
               door opens and Hannibal steps into the doorway.

               Jack surveys Hannibal’s collection of books and artifacts,

               Hannibal dangerously alone with Jack Crawford, who studies           
               framed meticulous pencil drawings of Parisian landscapes.

               Hannibal picks up a pencil and cuts a point with a scalpel,          
               blowing the shavings off the tip to reveal its sharpness.

                         Learned very early a scalpel cuts                          
                         better points than a pencil sharpener.                     
                                                                                    
               Hannibal sits down the pencil, but not the scalpel. He               
               listens to Jack, eyes drifting to the F.B.I. Agent’s jugular.

                         it’s hard to focus when you’re                             
                         thinking those whites are really                           
                         white or they must have hepatitis,                         
                         or is that a burst vein? So I try                          
                         to avoid eyes whenever possible.                           
               Hannibal isn’t deflected from making his observations.

                         I imagine what you see and learn                           
                         touches everything else in your                            
                         mind.  Your values and decency are                         
                         present yet shocked at your                                
                         associations, appalled at your                             
                         dreams.  No forts in the bone arena                        
                         of your skull for things you love.                         
               Hannibal has just described Will Graham to a letter, but he          
               is not about to give him the satisfaction of knowing it.

                         Whose profile are you working on?                          
                             (to Jack)                                              
                         Whose profile is he working on?                            
                                   HANNIBAL                                         
                         I’m sorry, Will. Observing is what                         
                         we do.  I can’t shut mine off any                          
                         more than you can shut yours off.                          
                                                                                    
               Will doesn’t appreciate the intrusion into his psyche.               
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                             (to Jack)                                              
                         Please don’t psychoanalyze me. You                         
                         won’t like me when I’m psychoanalyzed.                     
                         Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to go                      
                         give a lecture on psychoanalyzing.                         
               He scoots out of his chair and EXITS, leaving Hannibal and           
               Jack Crawford alone in the office.

                         he adopt your cadence of speech?

               He does and Crawford has definitely noticed it before.

                         I thought it was a gimmick to get                          
                         the back-and-forth going.                                  
                                                                                    
               Hannibal studies the PHOTOS of the Minnesota murder victims.

                         It’s involuntary. He couldn’t stop                         
                         himself if he tried.

                         What he has is pure empathy. And                           
                         projection. He can assume your                             
                         point of view, or mine -- and maybe                        
                         some other points of view that                             
                         scare him. It’s an uncomfortable                           
                         gift, Jack. Perception’s a tool                            
                         that’s pointed on both ends.

               Will stands underneath the sky considering the stars. An             
               eerie moment of silence, then a subtle crunching of grass

                         Smitten, I would say. She asked me                         
                         to keep an eye on you.

               bloodied face and the horrible streaks of madness vanish.

               The crime scene has now been decriminalized in Will’s mind.          
               Will pops an Aspirin behind the wheel of the rental car.             
               Lector unbuckles his seatbelt on the passenger side. Will            
               thinks a moment before getting out.                                  
                                                                                    
               Hannibal smiles, a hint of excitement.

               Will walks purposefully to the front door, trying his best           
               not to look uncomfortable. Hannibal purposefully lags                
               behind.  Will is halfway to the door when it suddenly opens:

               Bleeding and wheezing, she is shoved down the porch steps in         
               a heap, the door slamming shut behind her.

               He rushes to DYING LOUISE HOBBS. Her alabaster skin in sharp         
               contrast to the crimson pouring out of it. Multiple wounds           
               puncture her torso and arms. She grasps haltingly for Will,          
               streaking him with her blood.                                        
                                                                                    
               Her cold hand clutches his wrist as her body spasms. She’s           
               already gone and Will knows this.                                    
               He pries her slick, red fingers from his wrist, trying not to        
               see the last flickers of pain and fear exciting her face.

               Will smashes into it with everything he’s got. It’s hard to          
               say whether the sickening crack was from his shoulder or the         
               its wood frame. He gives it a well-placed kick, and another,         
               splintering it little-by-little until he can stumble INSIDE.

               He strolls casually up the walk, barely glancing at the              
               lifeless body of Louise Hobbs stepping deliberately over it.
