               We hear the steady, uneven rhythms of low, JAGGED BREATHS. A         
               moment, then WILL GRAHAM emerges from the darkness. He is            
               rain-soaked, drenched from head to toe, gun drawn. We are --         

=== ? INT. HANNIBAL LECTER'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT ===

                                                                                    
               CAMERA follows Will Graham as he steps into the dining room.         
               His movements are slow. So, so tense.                                
                                                                                    
               He slides toward the kitchen. Eyes darting. Comes round the          
               corner to see...                                                     
                                                                                    
               THE KITCHEN                                                          
                                                                                    
               Lights still on, blood and destruction everywhere.                   
               Will looks at the room, the blood smears and the chaos.              
               BLOOD POOLS from beneath the pantry door. Will crosses to            
               the pantry door and then stops, realizing he's not alone.            
                                                                                    
               ABIGAIL HOBBS stands in the kitchen.                                 
                                                                                    
               ON WILL -- stunned.                                                  
                                                                                    
               Abigail turns and sees him. Her face is tear streaked. She           
               is agitated, doesn't know what to do.                                
                                                                                    
               Will struggles to process her. They stare at one another.            
               Will can't begin to understand and yet understands totally...        
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         Abigail...?                                                
                                                                                    
                                   ABIGAIL HOBBS                                    
                         I didn't know what else to do. So                          
                         I did what he told me.                                     
                                                                                    
               Abigail begins to shake, fighting sobs.                              
                                                                                    
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                         Where is he?                                               
               Her face suddenly falls. Will has a millisecond to register,         
               and then, before he can react...                                     
                                                                                    
               HANNIBAL is looming behind Will. Arm coming round as if in           
               an embrace, moving swiftly. Will is still in shock about             
               Abigail when Hannibal warmly welcomes him with open arms.

                         You were supposed to leave.                                
                                   HANNIBAL                                         
                         We couldn't leave without you.                             
                                                                                    
               BLOOD SPRAYS up between them, splashing their faces.                 
                                                                                    
               Abigail SCREAMS as Will's gun drops to the floor and his             
               hands go to his belly. Abigail watches in horror as Will             
               staggers and falls against the wall. His gun out of reach.           
                                                                                    
               Will looks down --                                                   
               To see blood SPILLING from a WIDE CUT across his abdomen.            
               His INNARDS straining at the wound.

                         Time has reversed. The teacup I've                         
                         shattered has come together. A                             
                         place has been made for Abigail                            
                         once more in the world. Do you                             
                         understand? That place was made                            
                         for all of us. Together.                                   
                             (then)                                                 
                         I wanted to surprise you. And                              
                         you... wanted to surprise me.                              
               Will is shaking, trying to remain conscious and out of shock.

                         I let you know me. See me.  A rare                         
                         gift I've given you. But you                               
                         didn't want it.                                            
                                                                                    
               Will isn't so definitive.

               Hannibal winces almost imperceptibly.

                         You would deny me my life.

                         Not your life.

                         My freedom, then. You'd take that

               Hannibal studies Will a moment, realizing he's right.

                         us to the moment when the teacup                           
                         shatters. I forgive you, Will.                             
                                                                                    
               Hannibal stands next to a terrified Abigail who realizes             
               she's made a bargain with the devil.

               Hannibal is genuinely sad. Will has time for a single, shocked:

               And Hannibal CUTS ABIGAIL'S THROAT in a single, sleek motion,        
               right across the scar where her father once did the same.            
               Abigail's face shows shock and horror. And then blood SPRAYS         
               and Abigail crumples to the floor before Will.

               (NOTE: This should be deliberately reminiscent of the Hobbs          
               kitchen as Will tried to save Abigail in Ep. #101.)                  
                                                                                    
               Abigail clutches at her throat to stop the bleeding, but it          
               pours from between her fingers. Will is horrified.

                         You can make it all go away. Put                           
                         your head back. Close your eyes.                           
                         Wade into the quiet of the stream.                         
               They hold a look and then Hannibal disappears.                       
                                                                                    
               Will drags himself to Abigail and takes his hands from his           
               own terrible wound and places them against her throat.               
               Trying to stem the flow of bleeding.                                 
                                                                                    
               A bloody Will pulls Abigail to him, lifting her head higher          
               to try to stem the blood flow. And then it is too much and           
               Will collapses backward to the floor.

               He sees the BLACK STAG, it now lies on the kitchen floor,            
               breathing in great steaming gasps. Dying...                          
                                                                                    
               His eyes fixed on the black stag as its breath slows and             
               finally stops...

               BLOOD RISES between and around Will and Abigail, a SURREAL           
               POOL filling the room and ultimately submerging them.

               The surface ripples in the wake of Will and Abigail                  
               disappearing beneath it... then becomes still.

               The black stag floats in the blood, sinking away from CAMERA         
               until it disappears into the red-tinged darkness.

               Reflected in the surface, we can see a TEACUP falling toward         
               the blood pool. As it's about to break the surface, instead,         
               the surface breaks the teacup. It SHATTERS.

               They SPIN MIDAIR, floating in the grace of EXTREME SLOW              
               MOTION.  As the shards spin, we see they are stranger than           
               porcelain.  One has an eye, one a mouth, another a stubbled          
               jaw.  Then TIME REVERSES in EXTREME SLOW MOTION as the pieces        
               draw together forming, not a teacup, but:

               He floats off the floor that shattered him, again whole,

               Slowly flutter open. He gasps, wincing as he draws air into          
               his rib cage. He takes in his surroundings to find he is...

               A hospital bed holds him. Glowing monitors flank him. His            
               abdomen is freshly bandaged and stitched.                            
                                                                                    
               His eye finds a WALL CLOCK. In his shifting, blurring                
               vision, the numbers sag and drift onto the wall. Will stares         
               a moment -- until the minute hand CLICKS. Time is passing            
               and will continue to pass. This is no fiction of his mind.           
               A FIGURE                                                             
                                                                                    
               Until now unseen, moves at the foot of Will's hospital bed.          
                                                                                    
               A DOCTOR                                                             
                                                                                    
               Inspecting Will's chart. He replaces it and turns and                
               smiles, pleased to see Will is conscious.                            
                                                                                    
                                   DOCTOR                                           
                         How do you feel?                                           
               The man's question seems almost alien in its simplicity.

                         Thirsty.                                                   
                                                                                    
               The doctor hands Will the hospital-issue cup next to the bed,        
               and Will drinks slowly through the straw.                            
                                                                                    
               The doctor looks to the open door of the ICU; an indistinct          
               shadow indicates someone standing just around the corner.            
                                   DOCTOR                                           
                         Feel well enough for a visitor?                            
                                                                                    
               The doctor exits through the door. Though it's still open,           
               Will cannot see out it... until his visitor enters:

               Pale like Will, in a hospital gown of her own. She stands on         
               the threshold, staring at him. Will stares back and his              
               thoughts and ours are the same --

               CAMERA moves across the pool until an ANGULAR SHAPE breaks           
               the surface. As the shape rises, it becomes apparent it is           
               not rising at all -- the blood is receding around it.                
                                                                                    
               The blood continues to recede, revealing Abigail Hobbs's face        
               as she lies dying on the floor of Hannibal's kitchen -- only         
               now she is surrounded by darkness. The blood retracts into           
               her cut throat as she RISES IN A REVERSE COLLAPSE, gushes of         
               fluid REVERSE RAINING through the air as they track with her.        
               Finally, Abigail RISES IN HER REVERSE COLLAPSE, fitting              
               snuggly into Hannibal's arms. The blade in his hand runs             
               back across Abigail's throat, seemingly healing the wound.           
                                                                                    
               TIME STOPS for the briefest of moments, then moves forward at        
               NORMAL SPEED, and Abigail mutters:

               As the blade in Hannibal's hand begins to jerk...

               Abigail stands in front of Will's hospital bed. Pillows prop         
               Will up.  They look at one another. A reunion neither                
               thought they would ever see. After a moment:

                         cut me.  They said it was surgical.

               Abigail averts her eyes, still looking for rhyme and reason.

               They stand next to the fire, watching medical records burn.          
               Retro-Will stares at the burning clock drawing as CAMERA             
               finds Now-Will in the deep background, under the rain of             
               pages, watching Retro-Will and Retro-Hannibal.

               As the memory replays through the falling RAIN OF PAPER,             
               Retro-Hannibal never turns to face Retro-Will.

                         When we've gone from this life, I                          
                         will always have this place...                             
                                                                                    
               It's the same explanation he offered before, but there is a          
               discernible sadness in Retro-Hannibal's voice. And this              
               time, Will listens, waiting for any clue in the words.

                         Chapel in Palermo, severe and                              
                         beautiful and timeless.                                    
                                                                                    
               Retro-Hannibal pauses in his burning. Still facing away.

                         A single reminder of mortality: a

               Off those words, Now-Will looks to the floor beneath his             
               feet.  Beneath the scattered sheets of paper littering the           
               floor, he can glimpse a SKULL. Every page depicts his                
               drawing of the ENCEPHALITIS CLOCK.

               Numbers gathered at the bottom right of the pages, sliding           
               off the clock. The hands akimbo, stacked with the numbers --         
               then still in their akimbo state, BEGIN TO TICK BACKWARD.

               There is a FLICKER in the quality of light above Will.

               In the center of the chapel's floor, constructed directly            
               above the inlaid skeleton. At first glimpse, it appears to           
               be A HUGE HUMAN HEART. (NOTE: This is a direct pickup of the

               But a second look reveals it's A MAN'S BODY, SKINNED -- limbs        
               and back broken and folded to create the anatomical parts and        
               chambers of the organ. The victim's head, hands and feet are         
               missing, stumps portraying the muscle's severed vessels.             
                                                                                    
               The faux organ hovers above the floor, supported by a                
               makeshift tripod formed by a TRIO OF SWORDS run through the          
               body.  Down each blade, blood trickles.

               Will turns to leave, trying to glimpse what he can of the crime      
               scene investigation. He sees Inspector Donaggio talking with         
               the priest, who is now pointing in Will's direction. Donaggio        
               shouts across the chapel at Poliziotto LaManna and Will:

               glances back at Pazzi one last time.

               A WOMAN'S UPTURNED FACE -- a vine of flowers flows from her lips.

               It is reminiscent of Botticelli's Primavera, but the careful         
               viewer will note that this isn't a sketch of winged Zephyrus         
               clutching at the nymph, but rather a drawing of the dead man         
               and woman arranged in their honor in the back of the truck.

               Black ink begins to bleed through the paper, like blood

                         my life. A moment of epiphany that                         
                         made me famous and then ruined me.

               Uncomfortable memories, all too raw. In the background, the          
               DULL BANGING of a door as a POLIZIOTTO enters:                       
                                   POLIZIOTTO                                       
                         No, no.  La chiesa è chiusa. Questa                        
                         è ancora una scena del crimine.                            
                                                                                    
               Pazzi hands Will a folder full of crime scene photos, and            
               approaches the poliziotto, showing his badge.

               Pazzi guides the poliziotto to the exit.

               Will watches as Pazzi glances back over his shoulder one last        
               time before disappearing with the poliziotto. Will stands            
               there a moment, holding Pazzi's crime scene folder. Finally,         
               almost reluctantly, he pulls a single photo from the folder.

               He takes a breath, exhales, then closes his eyes. We hear            
               the slow THUD of his HEARTBEAT keeping rhythm with the               
               AMBIENT HUM of his CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.

               It swings in the darkness of Will Graham's mind, keeping

                         malleable. I skinned you.  Bent you,                       
                         twisted you and trimmed you. Head,

               The body SHUDDERS. One broken arm strains against the                
               cording holding it in place. SNAP!  The cord BREAKS and the          
               arm PULLS FREE. Another broken limb BREAKS THE STITCHES              
               holding it fast... and then another...

               He stumbles back, unnerved, tripping on the altar steps. More        
               restraints SNAP as another limb realigns... and next, a leg.         
               What resembles a nightmare flower blossoming, the body --            
               still without hands, feet or head -- resurrects its form...

               Unfolding now, approximating its original shape, starts              
               crawling forward as its cording and stitching hangs and              
               drags.  It crabs forward on stumps and knees.

               As the ANTLERED NIGHTMARE that unfurled from Antony Dimmond's

               Will leans against the altar, sweating, breathing heavily.           
               He opens his eyes to see Abigail walking toward him.                 
                                   WILL GRAHAM                                      
                             (off her concern)                                      
                         I do feel closer to Hannibal here.                         
                                                                                    
               He suppresses a small, uneasy laugh.

                         God only knows where I would be                            
                         without him.

                         What did you see?

                         He left us his broken heart.

                         How did he know we were here?

                         He didn't. But he knew we'd come.

                         He misses us.                                              
               Strange for Will to consider, but he remains suspicious.

                         Hannibal follows several trains of                         
                         thought at once without distraction                        
                         from any, and one of the trains is                         
                         always for his own amusement.

                         Always.                                                    
                                                                                    
               He tosses the photos of the broken man heart on the altar,           
               steps in front of Abigail.

                         You still want to go with him?

                         Yes.

                         He gave you back to me. Then took                          
                         you away. Lucy and the football.                           
                         He just keeps pulling you away.                            
               Will is contemplative a moment, then suddenly sad:

                         What if no one died? What if we                            
                         all left together? Like we were                            
                         supposed to. After he served the

                         He said he made a place for us.

                         A place was made for you, Abigail,                         
                         in this world. The only place I                            
                         could make for you.

               He opens his eyes, no longer submerged in his subconscious,

               Punic stone two millennia old. Will listens, carefully               
               monitoring his breath. He sees the walkway, weaving through          
               DOZENS OF MUMMIFIED CORPSES, leads down into a darkened maze,        
               only partially illuminated by infrequent candlelight.                
                                                                                    
               Following the ancient fortress wall as it leads him deeper           
               into less-aged corridors of the chapel's crypts and catacombs.       
                                                                                    
               Overhead, bare bulbs occasionally light the way, but mostly          
               the underground circuit remains shrouded in shadow. In the           
               distance ahead, Will hears unhurried footsteps.

               The unhurried footsteps stop as Will’s shout echoes along the        
               passageways. No reply.  A moment, then the footsteps resume          
               their march. Will arrives at a fork in the corridors and he          
               considers his choices.                                               
               Footfalls come deep from within the darkness; someone is             
               there.  Will runs after them, dogged, into the black. A              
               moment behind him --

               pauses for only a second before he follows Will.

               The clatter of footsteps changes. Due to the shape of the            
               gallery and the conducting power of the walls, the sound

               the pillars and the many passages... any of which Hannibal or        
               Will might have taken. He pivots, the seasoned cop, but              
               there are too many blind spots. Too many angles to cover.

               His imagination has flooded the catacombs in blood-red water.        
               Treading deeper into the tunnels, propelled by guilt.

               His voice RINGS down the depthless inky black.

               Stands, hiding among the mummified corpses. He hears the             
               plaintive offering -- and the echo that answers it -- but he         
               says nothing in reply.                                               
                                                                                    
               Instead, Hannibal takes a silent sidestep and is swallowed           
               entirely by the shadows.
