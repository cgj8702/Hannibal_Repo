               bathroom.  Old wood. A taste of a Europe from days gone by.

                         learned from Hannibal, too. He had

               the window, the landscape is revealed to be...

               The calm waters of the Arno reflecting the gaily-yellow              
               buildings crowding either bank.                                      
                                                                                    
               Jack walks to the center of the bridge, the Arno River               
               stretching in either direction. The Ponte Vecchio downriver          
               from him.

               Watches sunlight dance on the water. A wistful smile.                
               And then Jack lifts the lid from the urn, dips in a hand and         
               lifts out Bella's ashes.                                             
                                                                                    
               CLOSE -- as some escape on the light breeze. He leans out            
               and drops them into the water. Watches as they dapple the            
               surface and disappear.

               Bedelia stares absently at the CCTV camera until she is              
               distracted by a commotion. She glances over to see Jack              
               Crawford and Inspector Pazzi approaching through the crowd.

               obstructed and she is GONE.

               He arrives at Bedelia's usual bench and finds it empty; the          
               shopping bag from Vera dal 1926 is all that remains.

               For a moment, it appears as though he is lying on his back

               lights are dim as they ready to sleep. The water closet door         
               slides open revealing Chiyoh in a robe. She quietly enters           
               and crosses to her bed, climbing inside without a word. She

                         You may have had the last word with                        
                         Sogliato. Your colleague...                                
                             (off his notes)                                        
                         Signor Albizzi, tells me no one has                        
                         spoken to Professor Sogliato since                         
                         he declined your invitation to                             
                         dinner.  He is the second to have                          
                         disappeared from the Palazzo.                              
               Pazzi is keenly aware of the workers in the background,              
               giving him some semblance of safety with il Mostro.

                         Like any good investigator, I'm                            
                         sure you're sifting the                                    
                         circumstances for profit.                                  
               Pazzi's wheels spin as he surreptitiously studies Hannibal.

                         Both were bachelors, well-respected                        
                         scholars with orderly lives. They                          
                         had some savings, nothing much.                            
                                                                                    
               Hannibal reacts, recognizing something in Pazzi.

                         of all: Francesco. He attempted to                         
                         assassinate Lorenzo the Magnificent                        
                         in the cathedral, at Mass, in 1478.

               He nods to Hannibal and then walks away, plucking a brochure         
               on THE EXHIBITION OF ATROCIOUS TORTURE INSTRUMENTS as he             
               exits.  CAMERA STAYS ON Hannibal as Pazzi WIPES FRAME,

               As he watches Pazzi go. As CAMERA PUSHES IN, the image of            
               Hannibal PIXELATES as though it is on a computer monitor.

               To reveal the image of Hannibal is now on an Italian "WANTED"        
               AD on a website. Hannibal's height, weight and various               
               physical details are described.

               The "wanted" ad is reflected on his reading glasses as he            
               stares at the monitor with Hannibal's face.

               Pazzi opens a prepaid calling card and carefully punches in the      
               numbers before he gets a dial tone. Behind him, stone archways       
               and TOURISTS.                                                        
                                                                                    
               He glares at the card. A man with a decision to make.                
               Almost angry with himself, he consults a number on a piece of        
               paper and dials. It RINGS.  And then a well-spoken SWISS

               He opens his eyes, staring upward to see:                            
                                                                                    
               CHIYOH                                                               
                                                                                    
               She's suspended above him, penetrated many times over in a           
               bramble of antlers rising out of Will mythologically.

               Will opens his eyes in the quiet rocking of the cabin. He            
               slowly becomes aware there is no other sound in the room             
               beyond his own breathing. He glances into Chiyoh's bunk and          
               sees that it is empty.

               CAMERA prowls the darkened corridor, finding the door to the         
               rear platform. A silhouette framed against the night                 
               outside.  CAMERA reveals Will moving smoothly along the              
               passageway, in slippers, a coat covering his nightwear.              

=== ? INT. TRAIN - CABOOSE REAR PLATFORM - NIGHT ===

                                                                                    
               Chiyoh stands alone, braced against the railing, staring out         
               into the darkness unfurling behind the train. Will watches           
               Chiyoh from inside the caboose a moment, then joins her.             
                                                                                    
               The wind whips at them both.

                         I like the night.                                          
                             (then)                                                 
                         It's more than a period of time;                           
                         it's another place. It's different                         
                         from where we are during the day.

                         We're different from who we are                            
                         during the day. Little more                                
                         hidden, little less seen.

                         When life is most like a dream.                            
                                                                                    
               Will stares at her a moment, studying her.

                         Why are you searching for him?                             
                         What are you hoping to find?

                         I'm not searching for Hannibal. I                          
                         know exactly where he is.

                         Yes.

                         Why didn't you tell me you knew?                           
                                   CHIYOH                                           
                         I told you there are means of                              
                         influence other than violence.                             
                                                                                    
               She kisses Will tenderly on the lips, taking his breath away.

                         But violence is what you understand.                       
                                                                                    
               And with that, Chiyoh shoves Will violently over the railing,        
               sending him ass over teakettle into the night.                       
               Chiyoh takes a deep breath and lets it go and she begins to

               Face down. As the blur of the rest of the train CLATTERS             
               past above him. The noise is huge.  And then it is gone.             
                                                                                    
               Will lies silent amid the now-empty woods. Train tracks              
               running away from him to infinity.                                   
                                                                                    
               And then he is NUDGED. By something SHARP and BLACK.                 
                                                                                    
               Reveal it to be the antlers of the BLACK STAG. It nudges Will        
               like a dog would its injured master. Slowly, Will rouses,            
               comes around. Battered and bruised, but alive.                       
               Will drags himself to his feet, looks up the tracks and sees         
               the stag waiting patiently.                                          
                                                                                    
               And then it starts to walk in the direction of the train, and        
               Will obediently follows...

               Hannibal as he glances around the room, nodding to the restorers     
               who stare back at him, absent of any friendly demeanor.              
                                                                                    
               A cloth rests on a display case in the middle of the room.           
               On it -- a small picnic. A glass of wine, some good cheese,          
               a beautiful pear with a single bite taken out of it.

               Pazzi looks up. Hannibal is standing perfectly still on the          
               other side of the room. Was he there all this time?

               Pazzi sets his wooden case on top of Hannibal's desk as              
               Hannibal approaches, carving another bite mark out of the            
               pear in slices and eating them. He watches Pazzi's face.

                         Given the nature of your exhibition                        
                         and the content of our last                                
                         conversation, I brought something I                        
                         thought you might like to see.                             
               Pazzi opens the case. Inside there is A SCOLD'S BRIDLE -- a          
               Renaissance torture device that resembles an ornate-but-             
               grotesque metal mask fitted with a wicked, barbed mouth bit.

                         It was supposedly worn by Francesco                        
                         de' Pazzi when he met his end. My                          
                         family's guilt cast in iron.

               Pazzi watches closely as Hannibal goes to pick up the mask.          
               His fingers will leave prints all over the burnished metal.

                         Of course.                                                 
                                                                                    
               Hannibal sets his knife down and produces soft curator's             
               gloves, slipping them on and taking the bridle from its case.

               As Hannibal studies the piece, CAMERA includes the restorers         
               in the background as they leave the room.

                         I'm so glad you stopped by,                                
                         Commendator Pazzi, as I found                              
                         another family heirloom for you.                           
               Hannibal goes to a low cabinet under a display case. Pazzi           
               watches, Hannibal's back to him as he unlocks the case,              
               watching Pazzi's reflection in the glass.                            
                                                                                    
               Pazzi notices the Harpy knife Hannibal has left by the half-         
               eaten pear. There, on the hasp -- Hannibal's fingerprints.           
               Pazzi eyes Hannibal, then smoothly picks up the knife with           
               his handkerchief and slips it quickly into his pocket.               
                                                                                    
               Hannibal produces an OLD WOODCARVING of a man hanged by his          
               neck -- his entrails snaking down around his feet.

                         This is your ancestor, Francesco,

                         astray by thirty pieces of silver                          
                         from the hand of the Papal banker.

                         Yes, the archbishop, in all his holy                       
                         vestments, hanged beside Francesco                         
                         and provided no spiritual comfort.                         
                                                                                    
               Hannibal looms behind Pazzi. A dark, unfocused figure,               
               pointing at a detail on the woodcarving.

                         It's hard to see, but here's where                         
                         the archbishop bit him. Eyes wild                          
                         as he choked, the archbishop locked                        
                         his teeth in Pazzi's flesh.

               Hannibal's hands are busy as he talks, rolling a big floor           
               polisher into the room and working with its thick orange             
               power cord, tying a hangman's noose in the plug end of the           
               cord, making the traditional thirteen wraps.

                         I haven't had a bite all day.                              
                         Actually, your liver and kidneys                           
                         would be suitable for dinner right                         
                         away -- tonight, even -- but the                           
                         rest of the meat should hang a week                        
                         in the current cool conditions. I                          
                         did not see the forecast, did you?                         
                             (off his silent stare)                                 
                         I gather that means "no."                                  
               Hannibal completes the hangman's noose with a tug.

                         If you tell me what I need to know,                        
                         commendatore, it'd be convenient                           
                         for me to leave without my meal.                           
                         I'll ask you the questions and then                        
                         we'll see. You can trust me, you                           
                         know, though I expect you find                             
                         trust difficult, knowing yourself.                         
               The noose tied from electrical cord is passed over Pazzi's           
               head and secured around his neck.

                         When the police didn't come, it was                        
                         clear that you had sold me. Was it                         
                         Mason Verger you sold me to?

                         Thank you, I thought so. I called                          
                         the number on his "wanted" site                            
                         once, far from here, just for fun.                         
                             (then)                                                 
                         Have you told anyone in the                                
                         Questura about me? Was that a nod?                         
               Pazzi shakes his head "no" as his cell phone begins to RING.         
                                                                                    
               Hannibal removes it and answers.

                         Which do you think, commendatore?                          
                         Bowels in or bowels out?                                   
                             (then)

               In a fluid movement, Hannibal turns, his Harpy knife flashing up     
               Pazzi's front; he calmly tips Pazzi forward, out the window.

               Jack looks up just in time to see Pazzi's body tumble forward        
               from the window high above the square.                               
                                                                                    
               Pazzi falls to the extent of the electrical cable. It pulls          
               whip-crack taut with a loud CRACK -- Pazzi's neck snapping.          
               Only Pazzi's bowels continue the descent, ribboning from his         
               abdomen and raining down onto the ancient cobblestones below.

               He peers down at Jack in the square. Inhales the hollow              
               shock from the TOURISTS milling below. The rising murmur as          
               people begin to notice Pazzi's body.                                 
               JACK'S POV                                                           
                                                                                    
               Pazzi's body dangles above him. His head lolls at an                 
               unnatural angle. His intestines hang, entangled around his           
               feet.  A grisly puppet.                                              
                                                                                    
               And -- above -- is Hannibal.                                         
                                                                                    
               Hannibal and Jack hold their positions for a long moment, and        
               then Hannibal moves back inside.                                     
               It breaks the moment and galvanizes Jack who rushes for the          
               entrance.  Around him, the cries of surprise from the crowd          
               turn into screams of horror.

               Hannibal walks briskly through the hall on his way out.              
               There's the BANG of a door shutting and Hannibal stops,              
               listens.  He glances around the room, but sees no one.

               Hannibal listens for any sound to betray Jack's position.

               No response. Hannibal carefully edges into the room.

                         I am truly sorry about Bella. For                          
                         her, night and day would be very                           
                         much the same in the end.                                  
               The room is a miasma of shadows. The only sound -- the               
               recurring CREAK of the upright trolley jamming against the           
               window frame as Pazzi's body swings far below.

                         practice injections on an orange?

               Jack grabs Hannibal from behind and hurls him through a              
               display case in a SHOWER OF GLASS.                                   
               SLO-MO -- as glass falls and sprays, and the heavy implements        
               within fall slowly -- CRASH BACK TO REAL TIME in a CLATTER of        
               iron and TINKLE of glass. Hannibal's Harpy knife is thrown           
               clear into the shadows.                                              
                                                                                    
               Cut and shaken, Hannibal crawls toward a vicious-looking AX.         
               Jack sees his intent and uses a MEATHOOK -- swinging it into         
               Hannibal's calf and dragging him back toward Jack.                   
                                                                                    
               Hannibal's hands grasp and miss the ax. Jack slams him with          
               heavy fists, concussive blows.                                       
               Jack throws Hannibal who falls against the BREAKING WHEEL.           
                                                                                    
               Hannibal stares at Jack, blood staining his teeth. Jack              
               slams Hannibal with his fist, again and again. Hannibal's            
               head rocking back against the wheel. Arm strained to the             
               breaking point. But he lets the blows come. Regards Jack:

                         you returned her to it. Is that                            
                         where you're sending me, Jack?                             
                                                                                    
               Jack hits him again and Hannibal has his answer -- yes.              
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
         HANNIBAL Ep. #305 "Contorno"      FINAL DRAFT       11/30/14       36.     
                                                                                    
                                                                                    
               Jack YELLS in primal rage and releases the breaking wheel,           
               and Hannibal sags forward. Jack wheels him and hurls him             
               through another cabinet and into the scaffolding and packing         
               cases beyond. Another SHOWER OF GLASS.                               
               Hannibal lands, face stung with a hundred tiny cuts. Not             
               even trying to fight back. He slowly gets to his feet and            
               begins to limp away halfheartedly.                                   
                                                                                    
               Jack grabs Hannibal and drags him through the packing crates,        
               toward...

               Jack drags Hannibal toward the window.

                         How will you feel when I'm gone?

               Jack hurls Hannibal backward out the window.                         
                                                                                    
               SLO-MO -- CLOSE ON HANNIBAL'S FACE -- knowledge of his own           
               certain death there -- and then, he lashes out an arm and --         
               SEIZES HOLD OF PAZZI'S BODY.                                         
                                                                                    
               Snags his hand on Pazzi's clothes and belt. His other hand           
               grasps the electrical cord from which Pazzi is suspended.            
                                                                                    
               Hannibal hangs there, looking up at Jack. And then, he               
               slides down Pazzi's body and lets himself drop, past the             
               hanging entrails, and he lands hard and falls in the street.         
                                                                                    
               One last look up, and then he staggers away.
