               And then it stops. The knife-wielder scoots the diced                
               scallions into a ceramic dish with the blade, then places the

               Hannibal stands across the island from Jack Crawford, who            
               studies him intently. Jack’s mouth is moving, but we only            
               hear Hannibal’s RHYTHMIC BREATHING and HEARTBEAT against the         
               backdrop of his HUMMING CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.                          
                                                                                    
               Hannibal takes a breath and exhales, and SOUND RETURNS TO            
               NORMAL.  A dawning concern is washing over Jack Crawford.            
                                                                                    
               Then something subtle changes in Hannibal’s eyes, almost             
               immeasurable. But Jack Crawford measures it. We hear his             
               RHYTHMIC BREATHING and HEARTBEAT, which beats steadily over          
               the next action, but eerily does not accelerate.                     
               Jack’s hand drifts toward his coat, brushing his thumb across        
               the fasten of his sidearm holster. TIME SUDDENLY SLOWS AS

               Hannibal vaults over the kitchen counter as Jack pulls the           
               knife out of his wrist, swinging it immediately. The blade           
               whisks through the air, narrowly missing Hannibal.                   
               ON HANNIBAL                                                          
                                                                                    
               He yanks another knife from the cutting board and swings it          
               in a deadly arc. Jack jackknifes his torso to avoid the              
               blade, slashing back at Hannibal with quick swipes.                  
                                                                                    
               Hannibal deflects Jack’s knife with his own and they dodge,          
               parry and block each other’s blades.                                 
                                                                                    
               Jack thrusts and slices into Hannibal’s waist, who twists            
               around the knife, knocking it from Jack’s grip. Hannibal             
               lunges his knife at Jack’s belly, meaning to gut him.                
               Jack blocks the knife with a cutting board and then smashes          
               the cutting board into the side of Hannibal’s head, knocking         
               him off balance, but not quite down.

               He grabs Hannibal and bodily swings him crashing into the            
               cupboards. Hannibal throws his weight back at Jack, driving          
               him across the kitchen, but not far. Jack is solid.                  
               Jack maneuvers his arms around Hannibal’s throat and begins          
               to squeeze a chokehold. Hannibal writhes and kicks, trying           
               to throw Jack off balance, but to no avail.

               His eyelids flutter and pinch as he tries to focus and remain        
               conscious. His body goes limp and he slumps in Jack’s                
               arms... just enough for his shoulder to drop and allow his           
               hand to reach a SHARD OF GLASS on the floor.

               Hannibal plunges the SHARD OF GLASS into Jack’s neck. He             
               recoils and stumbles back, clutching his neck. Hannibal acts         
               quickly, picking up a butcher knife and turning on Jack.

               off, a TUG on his line reveals he's caught something.

                         The way we think is flawed, but the                        
                         flaws are systematic. Even when                            
                         irrational, we are predictable.

                         can't repress who he is. There's an                        
                         honesty in that I admire.

                         Yes.  She told me she was going to.

                         had to do. Evidently, she felt she

                         was misconduct. In my opinion, it                          
                         was a lapse in judgment.

                         destroyed. How that happened has                           
                         to be a matter of record.

               approaches down the long corridor with a CLICK in his heel.

                         he's never said to me. It isn't my

                         He asked her to hypnotize him to                           
                         recover memories.                                          
                             (re: the food)                                         
                         This is delicious.                                         
               This piques Hannibal’s interest.

                         Only in playing Dr. Bloom. It's                            
                         sad to see a brilliant psychiatrist                        
                         fall for such hoary old chestnuts.

                         She wants to believe him. I do, too.                       
               Chilton looks disappointed at that, plows on.

                         Not with me, of course, but with                           
                         anyone else who'll listen.                                 
                                                                                    
               Chilton is digging and teasing here. Enjoying himself.

               He tips his glass to Hannibal and then drinks as Hannibal            
               watches over the rim of his own drink...

               A low, man-made dam has been overrun by logs and trees,              
               likely from a compromised beaver-made dam.                           
                                                                                    
               The closed sluice gates used to fill it from a nearby river          
               have been breached. The pit on the other side has three feet         
               of dirty water in it.                                                
                                                                                    
               CAMERA reveals TWO PARKS AND REC LABORERS approaching the dam        
               in a small boat. They climb out of the boat, onto the dam and        
               look down into the pit and see the stagnant water in it.

               Parks & Rec One sloshes down the slope of wooden debris in           
               chest waders and thick rubber gloves, carrying a wooden pole.

               CLOSE as the waders slide through the water. Parks & Rec One         
               keeps inching forward, feet sticking now.

                         Aw, god. I stepped in something.

                         It's stuck to the bottom.                                  
                         Something pretty big.                                      
               He digs in with the wooden pole and stirs... The water sucks         
               and gurgles, and then --                                             
                                                                                    
               A SWOLLEN, BLOATED CORPSE rolls to the surface, skin sloughed        
               away, dark with decomposition, eyeless from the attentions of        
               insects.  Horrific. Parks & Rec One drops the wooden pole...         
                                                                                    
               Parks & Rec One fights for balance, but loses -- the corpse

                         It would seem Jack Crawford is less                        
                         suspicious of me than you are.

                         Agent Crawford doesn't know what                           
                         you're capable of.

                         Our point of view is, you were                             
                         already a murderer.

                         you as an intelligent psychopath.

                         I feel horrible. I got all the dogs

                         to file that report. You                                   
                         questioned my judgment when my

               Will sits in a chair at the table, head held back, eyes              
               rolling as a metal tube is forced between his teeth.                 
                                                                                    
               A plastic-sheathed arm holds his head/throat in an embrace.          
                                                                                    
               Hannibal’s face comes into CLOSE FOCUS and he puts something         
               down the tube...                                                     
               Hannibal pushes the food down with the handle of a wooden            
               spoon...                                                             
                                                                                    
               Hannibal removes the tube and pushes Will’s mouth and nose           
               closed with one hand, as his embrace stays ever tight with           
               the other...                                                         
                                                                                    
               CLOSE-UP -- Will’s face goes red, and then his throat works          
               convulsively and he swallows. Hannibal releases his nose and         
               mouth and Will gasps for air...                                      
               Hannibal’s hand reaches for a loaded needle on the table, an         
               empty one already lies beside it...

                         mistakes, too. Mistakes I believe

                         I don't know how to help Will. I                           
                         worry that he's a psychopath. And                          
                         I worry that he isn't.

                         Psychopaths are narcissists. And

                         were.  See if I could remember the                         
                         man whose classroom I walked into.

                         I remember that man. Memories are                          
                         all I have. Imagine how nice it is                         
                         to stumble on a new one.

                         I was almost certain. Almost.                              
                         Certain. Hannibal Lecter did this                          
                         to me.  It's a funny thing, doubt.

                         Doubt isn't natural. We imprint on                         
                         a version of the truth and have a                          
                         hard time letting it go.

                         I had nothing to prove to myself or                        
                         anyone else that Hannibal was                              
                         responsible. Not even a memory.

                         his fingerprints. We found nothing.

               Darkness.                                                            
                                                                                    
               CLOSE ON dark eyes as they open.                                     
                                                                                    
               Roland Umber. He groans, struggles, gasps for air.                   
                                                                                    
               He is stuck, trapped in close confinement. His eyes roll as          
               he sees what he is trapped by and he starts to freak out.            
                                                                                    
               CAMERA OVERHEAD PULLS OUT from his terrified face to reveal          
               he is stitched along the arms and legs to other bodies, bent         
               and formed around each other in a human tapestry.                    
               As a scream starts to build in Roland's throat...
