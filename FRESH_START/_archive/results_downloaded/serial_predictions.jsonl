B.A.U - MORGUE - DAY 2 12 ===\n\nThe CORPSES of MOTHER TURNER, FATHER TURNER, and their TWO\nCHILDREN (in body bags or covered in sheets) are presented on\nslabs for inspection.\n\nJack faces Zellar, Price, Katz, and Graham. He\u2019s like a\ndemanding father, presiding over his children as they present\nwhat they\u2019ve just learned at school. Will stands slightly\napart, not quite fitting into this surrogate family.\nBRIAN ZELLAR\nI\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have guns in my\nhouse. I would\u2019ve shot my sisters\nto get them out of the bathroom.\n\nBEVERLY KATZ\nI liked having a big family.\n\nJIMMY PRICE\nMy parents gave me a gift. A twin.\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you want two of me?\nBRIAN ZELLER\n(to Will)\nMust\u2019ve been an only child.\n\nWILL\n"}]}}]}}
